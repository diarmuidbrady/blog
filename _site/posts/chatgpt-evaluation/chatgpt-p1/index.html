<p>Is ChatGPT really the expert it claims to be? Read on to find out and learn something new and unexpected!</p>
<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>ChatGPT has become a subject of intense controversy. Views on this large language model (LLM) range widely, some see it as a powerful tool for the future of learning while others fear it will stifle innovation and creativity. One significant question is “can we rely on a Generative Artificial Intelligence’s (GAI) expertise on niche subject matters?” Like any technology, there are benefits and drawbacks. On the one hand it appears to be knowledgeable in many domains. However, ChatGPT is also known for hallucinating (stating nonfactual information with great certainty), putting its credibility into question.</p>
<p>To address this, I am evaluating ChatGPT’s knowledge on a topic I’m passionate about: film scores and their impact on the cinematic experience.</p>
<p>For this analysis, I focus on three genres; thriller, action and romance. While characters, themes, and plot are commonly discussed aspects of a film but a film’s soundtrack is overlooked and underappreciated.</p>
<p>By following along with this three part series, you’ll develop a brief understanding of:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>ChatGPT’s strengths and weaknesses.</li>
<li>A film soundtrack’s role in cinema.</li>

<section id="why-do-we-fall---the-dark-knight-rises-hans-zimmer" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-do-we-fall---the-dark-knight-rises-hans-zimmer"><em>Why Do We Fall</em> - The Dark Knight Rises (Hans Zimmer)</h2>
<p>Why Do We Fall is among my favourite pieces of film music. The title is half of a line of dialogue given by Alfred to Bruce in the Dark Knight Rises.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Why do we fall Mr.&nbsp;Wayne? So we can learn to pick ourselves up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The musical piece captures Bruce’s rise from The Pit at the end of the second act, on his return to save Gotham. The climb involves a long ascent up the pit wall with a final jump to a ledge at the top to secure his escape.</p>
<p>The music begins with strings as Bruce approaches the wall to make his climb. In the film, this is accompanied by a chant by the fellow inmates which translated means ‘rise’. As Bruce ascends the wall, the music intensifies and pace quickens using the brass’s power and the percussion’s rhythmic drive. As he makes the final leap of faith to escape, the music comes to a crescendo with a cliffhanging pause. In previous attempts to escape, Bruce fell short before the ledge causing him to fall. But this time he succeeds and the music reciprocates his redemption through a powerful finish.</p>
<p>Thematically, Bruce’s rise from the pit symbolises a pivotal moment in his physical and emotional character development for how he faces adversity. He not only regains his physical strength but also learns to embrace fear as a potent driver to escape the pit.</p>
<p>The drums mirror his heart beat. At the beginning, they are calm like Bruce. As he rises up the wall, the drums become more powerful, akin to his elevating heart rate and his acceptance of fear. The moment before the jump is when the drums and his heart rate are most intense and he feels the greatest fear. This fear is what drives him to successfully land the jump.</p>

My Prompt
</summary>
<p><em>Imagine you are a film score and soundtrack expert who has an undying passion for analysing the meaning behind the music composed for movies and films.</em></p>
<em>Could you discuss the meaning behind the piece ‘Why Do We Fall?’ and how Hans Zimmer combines specific musical instruments/sounds to communicate this meaning?</em>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
ChatGPT’s Response
</summary>
<p><em>Absolutely! “Why Do We Fall?” is a powerful piece of music composed by Hans Zimmer for the movie The Dark Knight Rises. It is an instrumental track that plays during some of the most emotional and pivotal moments of the film. Let’s explore its meaning and importance.</em></p>
<p><em>First, it’s essential to note that “Why Do We Fall?” is a recurring motif throughout the entire Dark Knight trilogy. It first appears in Batman Begins during the scene where Bruce Wayne is training to become Batman. This piece of music signifies Bruce’s struggle to overcome his fears and become the hero that Gotham needs.</em></p>
<p><em>In The Dark Knight Rises, “Why Do We Fall?” takes on a new significance. The film opens with Bruce Wayne broken and defeated, having lost everything he held dear. This track plays during the scene where Bruce is trying to climb out of the prison he’s trapped in. The music serves to underscore his struggle to overcome his physical and emotional limitations, and ultimately, his triumph over them. This theme is woven throughout the film, as Bruce Wayne, now physically and emotionally broken, must find a way to rise up and save Gotham once again.</em></p>
<p><em>In many ways, “Why Do We Fall?” is the heart of The Dark Knight Rises. It represents the film’s central theme of perseverance and the idea that even when we fall, we must get back up and keep fighting. This message is particularly poignant in light of the film’s release, which came shortly after the tragic shooting in Aurora, Colorado. The film’s message of hope in the face of adversity resonated with audiences, and “Why Do We Fall?” became a rallying cry for those seeking to find meaning in the wake of tragedy.</em></p>
<em>In conclusion, “Why Do We Fall?” is a powerful piece of music that encapsulates the themes of perseverance and hope that are central to The Dark Knight Rises. Its importance lies not just in its use in the film but also in the way it has become a symbol of resilience and strength for audiences around the world.</em>
</details>
<p>For this prompt, I wanted ChatGPT to discuss not only the piece of music, but also its role in the trilogy. It identified the moment it was played during the rise from the pit, followed by discussing broadly, the thematic meaning behind the phrase and how it relates to the character of Bruce Wayne himself. I am very happy with this response as it addressed the key points I was focusing on; how Bruce not only has the physical struggle of escaping the pit but also has the emotional limitation of accepting fear.</p>
<p>I was surprised by its mention of the Colorado shooting. The film’s impact on society was not a focus of my question. This emphasises the need for precise language when interacting with ChatGPT.</p>
<p>I had expected ChatGPT would comment on how drums mimic Bruce’s heartbeat beginning at rest and then building up as the scene grows in intensity. After a second prompt asking <em>“In the musical piece, I believe the drum mirrors Bruce’s heartbeat. Can you discuss this Idea?”</em> ChatGPT responded in agreement, elaborating how the drum mimicking a heartbeat is a common technique used in film scores to build tension and enhance the audience’s experience.</p>

<section id="recap" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>To recap, here is a breakdown of the results.</p>
<p>ChatGPT…</p>
<p>✅&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Describes the meaning of “<em>Why Do We Fall?</em>”” as a standalone piece of music and as a recurring motif in the trilogy.</p>
<p>✅&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discusses each instrument’s role in the composition.</p>
<p>✅&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mentions how the drum can mirror Bruce’s heartbeat after a second prompt.</p>
</section>
<section id="takeaways" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="takeaways">Takeaways:</h2>
<p>💡&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ChatGPT made no mistakes, and demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the film score and associated instruments, themes and character impact.</p>
<p>💡&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ChatGPT requires guidance and direction when answering questions on a broad topic. If you have a specific question, use precise language.</p>
<p>In this analysis, I focused on the instruments that comprise a score. Next week, we’ll explore if ChatGPT differentiate pieces that share a similar theme but belong to separate scenes for the character Captain America.</p>
