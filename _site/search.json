    "text": "When I was younger, a recurring phrase I often heard was, “Your college years are some of the best years of your life.” Me being me, I took this assertion quite seriously. If college was significantly valuable, I was determined to seize every opportunity it presented. I adopted an iterative approach, leveraging my experiences from past semesters alongside advice I received from others to inform my approach to each subsequent term.\nUpon reflection, I find this approach similar to a subsection of Artificial Intelligence called Reinforcement Learning, a concept ironically inspired by human learning. In this analogy, I acted as the Agent, navigating college life, which served as the Environment with each semester being each time step T. The beginning of each semester marked the State. My actions within each semester comprised the Action. The strategy I adopted each term became the Policy. How I felt at the term’s conclusion represented the Reward. Meanwhile, my expected emotional state, given a particular strategy within a semester, resembled the Value Function. My introspective process at the end of each semester mirrored the workings of a Learning Algorithm (my brain, I suppose).\nSimilar to any reinforcement learning algorithm, I had to find a balance between exploration (trying new things) and exploitation (sticking with what I knew). Throughout the first three years, I struggled to find what was right for me. But, with some persistent experimentation and self-reflection, I managed to find my place. I learned one key lesson from each semester, culminating in eight lessons that I intend to share across eight blog posts over the next eight weeks (credit to Deborah for that idea).\nEach year of my college experience revolved around a specific theme: Year 1 focused on Relationships, Year 2 delved into Lifestyle, Year 3 centred on Career, and Year 4 encapsulated Growth, bringing together aspects from the previous three years.\nMy aspiration with these posts is that they are valuable. I hope that reading about the lessons I’ve learned from my life can help you in navigating yours. To support your self-reflection, I’ll share three introspective questions each week that I asked myself at the time of learning each lesson. By answering these questions honestly, you may uncover blind spots that have been holding you back in surprising ways."

    "text": "What do you define as a close relationship? \nHave you experienced the difference between a shallow and a deep relationship? \nHow do you prioritise and maintain close relationships?\n\n\nMy first year of college marked a stark contrast from my secondary school Leaving Certificate year. In secondary school, I often spent considerable time alone. Yet, in college, it was a whirlwind of meeting people—everywhere I turned, someone new awaited.\nWhether in campus accommodation, clubs, societies, house parties, or during nights out, the initial semester revolved around encountering fresh faces nearly every day. Living in campus accommodation made chance encounters common, sparking conversations about our settling-in experiences, activities, or which nights we planned to venture into Dublin City Centre.\nInitially, meeting many new students and engaging in constant conversations was invigorating. However, as time passed, I noticed these exchanges seldom penetrated the surface. Despite my attempts to delve into topics that interested me, the shared enthusiasm often seemed lacking.\nConversations about my activities or learning pursuits were often met with a neutral response, akin to ‘sounds interesting, but not my thing.’ I had joined various clubs and societies, hoping for more meaningful interactions, yet found myself caught in repetitive conversations that didn’t quite match my interests. I desired deeper discussions but struggled to find like-minded people.\nDespite the many friendly encounters, I felt a persistent sense of solitude. I had yet to connect deeply with anyone new. Disappointed, I wondered if I was overlooking something. While it seemed like everyone had established their friend circles, I felt stuck in the middle.\nLooking back now, surrounded by friends I value, I’ve realised that prioritising spending quality time with people, immersing myself in supportive environments, practising patience, and allowing relationships to naturally develop were pivotal for me.\nBuilding and prioritising close relationships is important. Over time, surface-level connections can feel unfulfilling. Find people with whom you feel comfortable and can have fun, who celebrate your successes, and support you through failure. If you find yourself lacking close relationships, consider if you’re spending sufficient quality time around people, if your environment is supportive, or if you just need to be patient.\nIn conclusion, by the semester’s end, I wasn’t completely lost, I had found some friends with whom I enjoyed spending time. I hoped these relationships would deepen into something more meaningful. However, the second semester had other plans in mind for me, teaching me one of my most difficult lessons yet, which I’ll delve into in next week’s post."
