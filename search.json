    "text": "When I was younger, a recurring phrase I often heard was, “Your college years are some of the best years of your life.” Me being me, I took this assertion quite seriously. If college was significantly valuable, I was determined to seize every opportunity it presented. I adopted an iterative approach, leveraging my experiences from past semesters alongside advice I received from others to inform my approach to each subsequent term.\nUpon reflection, I find this approach similar to a subsection of Artificial Intelligence called Reinforcement Learning, a concept ironically inspired by human learning. In this analogy, I acted as the Agent, navigating college life, which served as the Environment with each semester being each time step T. The beginning of each semester marked the State. My actions within each semester comprised the Action. The strategy I adopted each term became the Policy. How I felt at the term’s conclusion represented the Reward. Meanwhile, my expected emotional state, given a particular strategy within a semester, resembled the Value Function. My introspective process at the end of each semester mirrored the workings of a Learning Algorithm (my brain, I suppose).\nSimilar to any reinforcement learning algorithm, I had to find a balance between exploration (trying new things) and exploitation (sticking with what I knew). Throughout the first three years, I struggled to find what was right for me. But, with some persistent experimentation and self-reflection, I managed to find my place. I learned one key lesson from each semester, culminating in eight lessons that I intend to share across eight blog posts over the next eight weeks (credit to Deborah for that idea).\nEach year of my college experience revolved around a specific theme: Year 1 focused on Relationships, Year 2 delved into Lifestyle, Year 3 centred on Career, and Year 4 encapsulated Growth, bringing together aspects from the previous three years.\nMy aspiration with these posts is that they are valuable. I hope that reading about the lessons I’ve learned from my life can help you in navigating yours. To support your self-reflection, I’ll share three introspective questions each week that I asked myself at the time of learning each lesson. By answering these questions honestly, you may uncover blind spots that have been holding you back in surprising ways."

    "text": "💡  What do you define as a shallow and a deep relationship?         How do you prioritise and maintain close relationships?         What is your experience with shallow and deep relationships? \n\nMy first year of college marked a stark contrast from my secondary school Leaving Certificate year. In secondary school, I often spent considerable time alone. Yet, in college, it was a whirlwind of meeting people—everywhere I turned, someone new awaited.\nWhether in campus accommodation, clubs, societies, house parties, or during nights out, the initial semester revolved around encountering fresh faces nearly every day. Living in campus accommodation made chance encounters common, sparking conversations about our settling-in experiences, activities, or which nights we planned to venture into Dublin City Centre.\nInitially, meeting many new students and engaging in constant conversations was invigorating. However, as time passed, I noticed these exchanges seldom penetrated the surface. Despite my attempts to delve into topics that interested me, the shared enthusiasm often seemed lacking.\nConversations about my activities or learning pursuits were often met with a neutral response, akin to ‘sounds interesting, but not my thing.’ I had joined various clubs and societies, hoping for more meaningful interactions, yet found myself caught in repetitive conversations that didn’t quite match my interests. I desired deeper discussions but struggled to find like-minded people.\nDespite the many friendly encounters, I felt a persistent sense of solitude. I had yet to connect deeply with anyone new.

While it seemed like everyone had established their friend circles, I felt stuck in the middle.\nLooking back now, surrounded by friends I value, I’ve realised that prioritising spending quality time with people, immersing myself in supportive environments, practising patience, and allowing relationships to naturally develop were pivotal for me.\nBuilding and prioritising close relationships is important. Over time, surface-level connections can feel unfulfilling. Find people with whom you feel comfortable and can have fun, who celebrate your successes, and support you through failure. If you find yourself lacking close relationships, consider if you’re spending sufficient quality time around people, if your environment is supportive, or if you just need to be patient.\nIn conclusion, by the semester’s end, I wasn’t completely lost, I had found some friends with whom I enjoyed spending time. I hoped these relationships would deepen into something more meaningful. However, the second semester had other plans in mind for me, teaching me one of my most difficult lessons yet, which I’ll delve into in next week’s post."

    "text": "💡  What do you believe confidence is?         What people, activities or situations impact your confidence either positively or negatively?         Do you believe you could improve your confidence?\n\nIn my final semester, I had no big plans. I aimed to stick with the clubs and societies I enjoyed, finish my coursework, and leave college content. At the start of the semester, there was talk about a boxing intervarsity competition, which seemed both thrilling and daunting. I lacked experience, and the idea of participating felt like a losing battle, I thought I’d get killed! Yet, as the weeks passed, I diligently worked on the basics as I learned in Semester 4, growing more comfortable in my form and sparring skills. On February 10th, I committed to entering the competition, with just five weeks to prepare. I weighed around 74kg, fighting in the 69kg weight class. Cutting 5kg in 5 weeks felt like a formidable task as I had no prior experience. I gathered insights from podcasts produced by the nutritionist I worked with in Semester 4. They addressed using a calorie tracker, implementing a mini-cut, and understanding the satiety index. I synthesised this information into a 5-week plan. To ensure my approach was sound, I reached out to my nutritionist, who approved my strategy but suggested fight week protocols to drop an extra 1-2kg if needed.\nMy plan revolved around three key principles:\n\nMaintain a calorie deficit to lose weight.\nConsume high-satiety foods to curb hunger.\nEnsure sufficient protein intake to preserve muscle.\n\nI made these specific changes:\n\nCalorie cut from 2750 to 1750 daily. I calculated this using the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Weight Planner.\nDaily protein intake at 1.5-2g per kilogram body weight. Focused on chicken, turkey, egg whites and powdered whey.\nIncreased intake of filling fruits and non-starchy vegetables.\nOpted for high-satiety carbohydrates like potatoes and oats.\nMade low-calorie swaps like low-fat milk, 1-calorie spray and low-cal sauces.\nDrank water and coffee in the morning to offset hunger\nTracked calories by weighing all food items.\nAvoided highly palatable food like chocolates and sweets.\n\nMy weekly training involved:\n\n3 boxing sessions\n2-3 gym and sprint sessions\nyoga and gymnastics for fun and relaxation\n\nInitially, everything went well, I made progress in training and the diet didn’t seem to both me too much. However, after three weeks, my energy plummeted, leading to constant fatigue and hunger. This affected my thoughts and emotions, creating a cycle of food preoccupation. Despite this, I felt unexpectedly resilient. I believed I could tackle any challenge I set my mind to, fostering a sense of confidence I hadn’t anticipated.\nOn the day of my first fight, I found myself still above the required weight (69kg). After spending an hour in the sauna (15 minutes at a time), I finally made weight, bringing a sigh of relief. Following that, I rehydrated and prepared myself both mentally and physically by focusing on my fight plan and doing warm-up exercises. When it was my turn, I entered the ring feeling focused rather than nervous. I was reserved and tense initially, but as the fight progressed, I became more aggressive, landing more powerful shots and gaining control. It was clear I was the stronger opponent and I won by unanimous decision.\nI had reached the All-Ireland Intervarsity final against an opponent, boasting greater experience, speed, and agility. This showdown was scheduled two weeks ahead. During this period, I closely studied his bouts, strategising with my coach to counter his style. Doubtful thoughts lingered in my mind about his superiority over me. However, learning from Semester 5, I let go of any expectations I had of winning, allowing me to dedicate my focus to training and mental preparation.\nWhen the fight day arrived, I was ready. I had managed to cut my weight to 69kg during the week, making the weigh-in effortless. I warmed up and performed pad work with my coach. My name was called out and I made my way up to the ring. Stepping into the ring, my face was greased with Vaseline, gloves were snug on my wrists, and the head guard was fixed to my head. I geared up for the face-off, the referee outlined the rules, we tapped gloves and we returned to our respective corners.\nDing-ding! Round 1 — I moved out aggressively. I cornered my opponent, poised to land heavy blows, but he evaded swiftly to the side. Undeterred, I pushed him into the next corner and he dodged again. And a third time, BOOM! He countered with a lead hook, caught me off guard and knocked me off balance. I fell against the ropes and I got a standing count. This cat and mouse continued, with him dodging and countering many of my shots. I felt I was off to a bad start. Returning to my corner, I was advised to relax the power and throw shots more frequently.\nDing-ding! Round 2 — The next round saw me quickly moving out, with a more relaxed form, I let my jab go more often. I became better at closing the gap and wearing him down. As I noticed his guard drop, I landed my shots. The momentum began to shift. After the second round, I returned to my corner, seeking more advice. Sensing his fatigue, I stood up early, eager to show my tenacity.\nDing-ding! Round 3 — Once more, I charged forward, controlling the space, making it clear I was driven to win. I watched his evasions become slower and more predictable. Despite feeling exhausted, I disguised it by keeping on the front foot. At a pivotal moment, I managed to pin him against the ropes, launching a combination of shots. Sensing his mental fatigue, I battled to wear him down entirely, I pursued him relentlessly until the final bell.\nThe final bell rang and I returned to my coaches who were cheering. I asked them “Is that it? Is it over?”, my coach laughed, “Ye, it’s over…are you alright???”, “Ye I’m fine, I just want to know I can relax.” After removing my head guard, gloves, and gum shield, I approached the centre stage. As the referee grasped both our hands, the judges began to speak. I mentally prepared for defeat by telling myself I had lost and that it was all okay. But my hand was raised and I surged with joy as I claimed sweet victory. It was an electrifying moment, the culmination of tireless effort finally swinging in my favour.\nExiting the ring, I proudly accepted my All-Ireland medal and hugged my coach, who shared my triumph. I returned to my family who shared my glee. On the way back in the car, I spoke to my brother saying “You know it’s strange, doing this has been the most exhausting thing I’ve ever done but I’ve never felt calmer inside.” He told me he had noticed it too.\nMonths of intense training aimed at a singular goal had unexpectedly built a newfound confidence that manifested as a feeling of calmness. It was like stepping into a quiet room for the first time, where once, there had always been a buzzing noise. I realised that confidence was less about grandeur or and more about easing anxiety and finding comfort within oneself. If you want to build confidence, I believe in aiming for something challenging and meaningful. Then, pursue it with all you have."

    "text": "Conclusion\n\nYou can’t connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backward. - Steve Jobs\n\nReflecting on the past four years of my life has been a meaningful endeavour. What once felt like mistakes to be forgotten have transformed into pivotal moments of my story. Without them, I wouldn’t possess the insights I do today. This realisation reinforces the idea that mistakes aren’t an obstacle to growth; they are an essential ingredient. Steve Jobs’ quote recognises that clarity is often not gained until you stop and take time to look back. Looking ahead, I feel confident about placing myself in situations where I’m likely to make mistakes, recognising the opportunities for learning they bring.\nI firmly believe that one’s response to life events matters more than the events themselves. This perspective acknowledges that challenges are inevitable but you always have the power to take control of your life instead of letting externalities dictate it. In this process, self-reflection serves as an invaluable tool, allowing you to integrate and embrace your past mistakes.\nNow, I invite you to contemplate the three greatest mistakes in your life. Write out your experiences before and after each mistake and how they impacted you. Carry out a brainstorming session to extract lessons from each mistake. Write down any and all types of lessons—this will be eye-opening. Another takeaway from Jobs is that you can connect the dots however you see fit. Initially, I thought I had eight lessons ready to go, but after a comprehensive brainstorm, I generated 176, this means I had 22 sets of lessons to choose from. The key is to strike a balance between specificity (tailored to the event) and generalisability (applicable to various aspects of life).\nAs you select lessons for this series, prioritise honesty, accuracy, and coherence. Post-brainstorm, reframe your experiences through the lens of the lessons learned. Consider how your actions contributed to learning the lesson rather than making the mistake, reframing the narrative. Subsequently, redraft and edit your work into a cohesive story.\nTo embrace self-reflection, identify your mistakes, focus on the lessons learned and start writing."

    "text": "💡  Have you ever tried to improve yourself using elaborate or esoteric changes?         Were you satisfied with the results?         Have you managed to stick with those changes? \n\nThis semester was pivotal. It was the final term before my grades factored into my final mark, and I was determined to be well-prepared. I wanted to avoid reaching my third year without a plan for improving my grades. I aimed to be ready, so I devised a plan: establish a consistent sleep routine, study hard, and train hard.\nThis plan didn’t work very well. It was hard to stick to. I was trying to improve everything all at once and as a result, I made an initial change but then quickly fell off. I felt tired during workouts, and my study sessions lacked productivity. I needed a better strategy. I hypothesised that making incremental habitual changes in sleep, exercise, nutrition, and study would collectively improve my overall grades. But I lacked the knowledge to implement these changes effectively and I needed help.\nHaving followed a few online coaches for some years, I got a lot of value from their philosophy and practical guidance on training and life. Consequently, I reached out to a strength coach and a nutritionist, shared my goals and sought their guidance.\nGradually, I introduced various changes. I tracked my sleep using an app, incorporated aids like a sleep mask and earplugs to ensure complete darkness and silence (two vital factors of sleep hygiene), put a wind-down routine in place between 9 pm and 10 pm to fall asleep faster, and began my morning with a walk.\nIn terms of nutrition, I planned meals weekly, cooked in bulk, tracked calories, ate more fruit and veg, increased my protein intake and drank around 2.8 litres daily (~40ml per kg bodyweight). I practised mindful eating with chocolate several times a week to improve my relationship with food. I prioritised stopping when I felt full instead of bingeing food.\nOn the exercise front, I structured two upper body, two lower body, and one full body mobility session weekly, and dedicated ten minutes daily to moving each joint.\nRegarding study, I planned each week, chose a distraction-free study space, and focused on one topic at a time for two-hour blocks, aiming for three sessions per day (occasionally adjusting to four or two blocks depending on how I felt).\nTo unwind, I relaxed in the evenings with friends and made the most of the weekends by going on trips to explore new places.\nTackling two or three habits at a time over several weeks made the process less daunting. Seeking advice from my coaches when questions arose significantly eased the process and without them, I would have struggled to make the progress I did.\nWith the changes in place, I felt great physically, mentally, and emotionally. Notably, my sleep and nutrition improved substantially, boosting my overall energy levels. My training progressed remarkably, and my study sessions became highly productive.

I hadn’t done anything crazy, I had simply adopted several small habit changes and sustained them over time.\nIf you want to improve your life, focus on making small changes that produce great returns. Often, the most impactful changes are basic and are observed over the long term, such as consistent darkness for your sleep, daily movement for your body or intense focus for your work. The real challenge lies in deciphering what you can adhere to consistency as part of your daily life.\nEntering my third year, I felt ready. I had put in the work and it had paid off. While I maintained my class ranking, I believed I could do better. But you know what they say, “Man plans, and God laughs.” Join me next week to discover how my grand plan unfolded and whether I set the right goals in the first place."

The real challenge lies in deciphering what you can adhere to consistency as part of your daily life.\nEntering my third year, I felt ready. I had put in the work and it had paid off. While I maintained my class ranking, I believed I could do better. But you know what they say, “Man plans, and God laughs.” Join me next week to discover how my grand plan unfolded and whether I set the right goals in the first place."

    "text": "💡  What is your idea of fun?         Do you believe spending time having fun is important?         How much time do you spend having fun? \n\nI kicked off my second year with one goal in mind—to have as much fun as I possibly could. Reflecting on my first year, it dawned on me that I’d dedicated an awful lot of time to studying. I worried that my future self might regret not having indulged in the “full college experience.” At the time, I believed university fun mainly revolved around drinking and partying. So, naturally, I figured if I wanted to have more fun, I should drink and party more while leaving hard stuff like studying, working out, and meal prep to the waist side. And that’s exactly what I did. I found myself attending regular house parties and drinking.\nOver time, I started feeling a sense of freedom, thinking I was finally “letting loose” and truly getting “the full college experience.” But then came a turning point. One night, running late for a party, I decided to “catch up”. So, I downed a shoulder of vodka and pure orange and pineapple mi-wadi. Due to a system memory corruption error, I’m unable to give specific details of what occurred after, nor would I want to. The main thing is the following day was the worst I had ever felt physically. I didn’t attend lectures and just lay in bed feeling miserable and sorry for myself.\nFollowing that episode, I reflected on the past few weeks and had a real wake-up call. My new lifestyle left me feeling more drained, anxious, irritable, unfocused, and scattered than ever before. My workouts stagnated, and my academic work suffered. So, I asked myself:\n\nDiarmuid, I don’t like this. I feel like shit. Why am I doing it?\n\n\nBecause this is fun. It might be difficult, but this is fun, right?\n\nNo. No, it was not. I was chasing what I thought others found fun, trying to fit into their idea of a good time. But truth be told, this wasn’t fun for me. What I truly enjoyed was getting up early (7 am), diving into study and programming, going to the gym or rock climbing, cooking proper meals, hanging out with friends and family, watching movies and TV series, reading, listening to music, exploring new places, and going to bed early (10 pm).\nBe careful not to conflate other people’s idea of fun as what you find fun. When you’re in the middle of what’s supposed to be a great time, take a mental note of how much you’re genuinely enjoying it. Separate the hype from your experience.\nAs the semester drew to a close, I tried to make up for lost time. I did alright, but I knew there was room for improvement. I desired a change. In the next semester, I delved deep into topics like self-development and behaviour change. I had ranked third in my class, but I began to wonder—if I pushed myself, could I reach second or even first place?"

I looked forward to intriguing work and being part of a team. However, I held concerns about the working environment. Growing up, media often depicted a bleak view of the professional world, featuring burnt-out employees, horrible bosses, and draining work, think of Fight Club, Horrible Bosses, or Mad Men.\nWhile I recognised these portrayals were exaggerated for effect, I worried about any underlying truths echoed by anecdotal evidence I had gathered over the years. I wondered, would my manager be a narcissistic, egomaniac!? Would the culture be so competitive and toxic that everyone saw each other as instruments to be used for their gain!? Would the work be so mind-numbing that I would wake up every morning before work thinking, “Oh no, not again!”?\nFortunately, I had worked with the company in a previous internship and any concerns I had proved to be unfounded. People were collaborative rather than competitive. We worked together and helped each other out. I valued the office setting for the spontaneous discussions that wouldn’t have been possible remotely from home. During lunch, engaging conversations with the team ranged from personal experiences to ongoing projects. Post-work meet-ups always had a crowd making it easier to meet people and get to know them better. I had the autonomy to think of ideas and turn them into projects. I made the most of opportunities to present work and practice my public speaking skills.\nManagement invested time into developing people on the team and shared their expertise without ego.

Career priorities differ among people but across any public or private sector, any level of business ownership, I believe people and work are a constant and greatly impact your quality of life. Figuring out what people you work well with and what kind of work stimulates and challenges you meaningfully is worthwhile. While I was fortunate to find this in my initial internship, others might need more time. Ultimately, I believe answering these questions can shape your career’s impact on your life quality.\nNext week, I’ll delve into hobbies, relaxation, and the genuine value of college.

    "text": "💡  What hobbies do you enjoy?         How do your hobbies impact the other areas of your life?         Are there ways to make your hobbies more sociable?\n\nDuring the summer before my final year, I assessed where I was at and how I would approach the subsequent year. I contemplated two distinct approaches: aim for grades or aim for fun. Honestly, grades no longer motivated me, I had already beaten that horse to death. Although, I still held some guilt over not placing grades as my top priority. Fortunately, I experienced an epiphanic mindset shift after reading the introduction of “10 Steps To Awesome Grades (While Studying Less)” by popular productivity YouTuber, Thomas Frank.\n\nFor most students, my opinion on grades is that they do not need to be perfect. After you define your goals, you’ll find that your coursework is not a magical Hogwarts train that will take you to them. It’ll help, but alone it’s inadequate. Focus on getting good grades while also gaining skills outside of class, building things, doing extracurriculars, making connections and - yes - making time to have fun.\n\nI immediately set a new goal: minimise study time and maximise getting the “full college experience” that I had chased back in Semester 3. Armed with previous learnings, I knew what I did and didn’t like. My only requirement was to ensure that the graduation cert I received the following October contained the three characters “1.1”, apart from that, the world was my oyster.\nIn my final year, Dublin City University offered 134 clubs and societies. After examining the list one by one, I carefully chose fifteen clubs to join: Book, Boxing, Camping, Circus Arts, Dance, Debate, Enactus, Fotosoc, French, Gymnastics & Trampolining, Hockey, Mental Health, Mixed Martial Arts, Speakeasy, and Yoga. Despite my intentions, I never attended six and only went to four of them once or twice but I religiously attended boxing, debate, Enactus, gym & tramp, and yoga weekly.\nMy weekly calendar was jam-packed with yoga, boxing, and gym & tramp on Mondays; Enactus and debate on Tuesdays; boxing and gym & tramp on Wednesdays; yoga, debate, and sometimes Enactus on Thursdays; upper body gym on Fridays, and lower body gym on Saturdays, accumulating up to 20 hours outside of college work on extracurricular activities.\nWhat caught me off guard most was the sharp focus I possessed during lectures. I spent only one hour reviewing notes which was half the usual time for a set of weekly slides, absorbing most information during lectures.\nI maintained a packed schedule of fun, invigorating rather than draining, social activities. I developed my public speaking skills during debate, and leadership and entrepreneurship during Enactus. It felt like having my cake and eating it. I realised the importance of hobbies that complemented my studies instead of counteracting them. While it’s commonly believed that dedicating more time to work produces better results, the law of diminishing returns says after a certain point, working becomes futile. While greater input resulting greater output can apply to manual, repetitive tasks. In my experience, prioritising leisure activities outside work significantly boosted my study efficiency. During this semester, I found that the heavy lifting for work demanding creativity, ideation and problem-solving, was performed subconsciously during downtime. When I began to tackle my work, often, my brain had already formed a partial solution, and now I just had to flesh it out.\nThe revelation that hobbies affect work productivity didn’t fully sink in until this semester. Productivity is affected by not only what you do while working but also how you spend your time outside of work. To improve productivity, it’s worth addressing both aspects. I recommend filling your spare time with fun, social activities that benefit your future self. That way, you can enjoy your life now and make progress later. You can have your cake and eat it. This lesson can seem incredibly obvious but it’s easily forgotten and hard to put into practice.\nAs the semester concluded, I thought I had peaked in happiness. Little did I know what was in store for me in my final semester at Dublin City University. To find out how the story ends, come back next week, for the finale."

I spent only one hour reviewing notes which was half the usual time for a set of weekly slides, absorbing most information during lectures.\nI maintained a packed schedule of fun, invigorating rather than draining, social activities. I developed my public speaking skills during debate, and leadership and entrepreneurship during Enactus. It felt like having my cake and eating it. I realised the importance of hobbies that complemented my studies instead of counteracting them. While it’s commonly believed that dedicating more time to work produces better results, the law of diminishing returns says after a certain point, working becomes futile. While greater input resulting greater output can apply to manual, repetitive tasks. In my experience, prioritising leisure activities outside work significantly boosted my study efficiency. During this semester, I found that the heavy lifting for work demanding creativity, ideation and problem-solving, was performed subconsciously during downtime. When I began to tackle my work, often, my brain had already formed a partial solution, and now I just had to flesh it out.\nThe revelation that hobbies affect work productivity didn’t fully sink in until this semester. Productivity is affected by not only what you do while working but also how you spend your time outside of work. To improve productivity, it’s worth addressing both aspects. I recommend filling your spare time with fun, social activities that benefit your future self. That way, you can enjoy your life now and make progress later. You can have your cake and eat it. This lesson can seem incredibly obvious but it’s easily forgotten and hard to put into practice.\nAs the semester concluded, I thought I had peaked in happiness. Little did I know what was in store for me in my final semester at Dublin City University. To find out how the story ends, come back next week, for the finale."
