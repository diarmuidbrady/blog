    "text": "When you observe masters of any skill, they always have a strong grasp of the fundamentals.\nBut when we’re learning new skills, we’re eager to move on to the most exciting areas. We get distracted by the attractive parts of the skill, we neglect the simple basics, and this stunts our progress. I believe that to master any skill, you must continually refine the basics because the highest peak has the strongest base.\nPython was a large aspect of my BSc in Data Science. I’ve continued to strengthen my basics through internships, personal projects, and in my current job. However, I’ve noticed I’ve become habitual in my choice of tools, using the same knowledge repeatedly. The course, “Python For Data Science, AI & Development” on Coursera, exposed the gaps in my knowledge and refreshed my understanding of the core topics."

    "text": "Escape \\ the SyntaxError !\nWhen working with strings, the escape character \\ (backslash) is a handy way to include special characters in your strings. The backslash changes the meaning of the next character. You can also avoid syntax errors by using the backslash!\nIn Python, apostrophes and quotation marks must come in pairs. Unpaired quotation marks create syntax errors. The example below returns a syntax error because the apostrophe in “friend’s” is unmatched.\nprint('Jimmy borrowed his friend's phone')\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)\nTo solve this dilemma, use one of the following:\n# Just use double quotes silly!\nprint(\"Jimmy borrowed his friend's phone.\")\n\n# Triple single quotes to allow multi-line strings.\nprint('''\nJimmy borrowed his friend's phone.\n''')\n                                            \n# Triple double quotes if I'm feeling fancy ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n# Or if it's a docstring as per PEP 257\nprint(\"\"\"\nJimmy borrowed his friend's phone.\n\"\"\")\nBut wait! There’s one more I had forgotten about…the escape character.\n\nprint('Jimmy borrowed his friends\\'s phone.')\n\nJimmy borrowed his friends's phone.\n\n\nVoilà! Problem solved. For the record, double quotes is my preference for greater readability.\n\nThere are many escape characters, including \\t (tab space), \\n (newline) and \\'. Another escape character is the carriage return, \\r. It moves the cursor to the start of the current line and proceeds to overwrite the text.\nNow you can create the cool loading symbol that appears when installing a library from Pip or Conda!\nRun the following code in a Python file, and you’ll see the loading symbol on the right.\n\n\nimport time\n\nloading = ['|', '/', '-', '\\\\']\nfor i in range(50):\n    print(f\"{loading[i % len(loading)]}\\r\")\n    time.sleep(0.2)"

    "text": "get() rid of the KeyError!\nDictionaries are one of my favourite data structures in Python. They are intuitive, useful, and efficient. After creating a dictionary, you can add, update, or delete key-value pairs. Please see the code example below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColour or color? That is the question.\n\n\n\nI write colour as color when coding Python because the language is written in American English as opposed to UK English. I thought I would point this out before the grammar police get me!\n\n\n\n# Create the dictionary using empty curly brackets.\ndict_color_code = {}\n\n# Add a key-value pair using square brackets of white and the hex color code\ndict_color_code['white'] = '#FFFFFF'\n\n# Find the hex color code of white using square brackets\nprint(f\"White hex color code: {dict_color_code['white']}\")\n\n# Let's update the value for white\ndict_color_code['white'] = '#F8F6F0'\n\nprint(f\"New value for white: {dict_color_code['white']}\")\n\n# Now let's remove white\n# Pop will return the value of the key 'white'\ndict_color_code.pop('white')\n\nWhite hex color code: #FFFFFF\nNew value for white: #F8F6F0\n\n\n'#F8F6F0'\n\n\nAbove, I demonstrated the basic actions of the dictionary. We finished by deleting the key we had created. Now let’s try to fetch that key-value.\n# Check that white is not there\nprint(dict_color_code['white'])\nKeyError: 'white'\nImagine that I want to avoid this error. I could check if the key is in the dictionary first:\n\nk = 'white'\nif k in dict_color_code:\n    print(dict_color_code[k])\n\nLucky for us, we have the get() dictionary method. get() returns the value of a given key and None if the key doesn’t exist.\n\nprint(dict_color_code.get('white'))\n\nNone\n\n\nThese are two solutions to the same problem. I prefer the get() method as it handles non-existent keys. The approach you choose is up to you."

    "section": "Amazing Arguments",
    "text": "Amazing Arguments\nA function is a great way of automating mundane tasks. They are a key part of writing concise, readable, and reproducible code.\nIn recent versions of Python, there have been updates made to how arguments are used. Firstly, there are two types of arguments:\n\nPositional: passed first in the function call and are identified using order.\nKeyword: passed after positional arguments and are identified by name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Rule\n\n\n\nPostional arguments must ALWAYS come before keyword arguments. Specifying a positional argument before keyword arguments results in an error.\n\n\nLet’s define a handy function below. I actually used this the other day!\n\ndef check_substring(\n    s:str               # a string\n    ,substrings:[]      # a list of substrings\n    ,all_strings: bool = False  # a boolean to choose between all and any\n    ):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a list of substrings is present in a string. \n    If all_strings, all substrings must be present in s to return True.\n    Else, there must be at least one occurance to return True.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if all_strings: return all([substring in s for substring in substrings])\n    else: return any([substring in s for substring in substrings])\n\nThis function has three parameters. All arguments can be specified as positional or keyword. all_strings is the only argument with a default value (False).\n\nsubstrings = ['man', 'ant', 'who']\ns = 'Maniac is a brilliant TV show.' # Some substrings present\n\n# This is how I call the function whe  all_strings is False\nprint(f'any substrings in s: {check_substring(s, substrings)}')\n\n# This is how I call the funciton when all_strings is True\nprint(f'all substrings in s: {check_substring(s, substrings, all_strings=True)}')\n\n# I usually use positional arguments for the first few, then keywords\n# Let's use all keywords to show that works too\nprint(f\"any substrings in s: {check_substring(s=s, substrings=substrings, all_strings=False)}\")\n\n# And all positional for completeness\nprint(f\"any substrings in s: {check_substring(s, substrings, False)}\")\n\nany substrings in s: True\nall substrings in s: False\nany substrings in s: True\nany substrings in s: True\n\n\nNow I’d like to make two changes.\n\nI want all_strings to be a keyword-only argument.\nI want to pass each substring as an argument rather than as part of a list.\n\n* solves both issues. See the example below.\n\ndef check_substring(\n    s:str               # a string\n    ,*substrings      # an interable tuple of substrings (note: *)\n    ,all_strings: bool = False  # a boolean to choose between all and any\n    ):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a tuple of substrings is present in a string. \n    If all, all substrings must be present in s to return True.\n    Else, there must be at least one occurance to return True.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if all_strings: return all([substring in s for substring in substrings])\n    else: return any([substring in s for substring in substrings])\n\nNow all_strings must be passed as a keyword (never positional). This is helpful because code readability is important. While this function only has three arguments, there are many functions with too many arguments to count. Thus, using positional arguments wouldn’t make sense and would be a pain to decipher in those cases.\n\ns = 'Maniac is a brilliant TV show.' # Some substrings present\n\n# Now we can add substrings manually to the function call.\nprint(f\"any substrings in s: {check_substring(s, 'man', 'ant', 'who')}\")\n\nany substrings in s: True\n\n\nEverything works dandy above, but what happens if we do pass all_substrings as a positional argument?\nLet’s fuck around and find out!\n# now let's change all to True\nprint(f\"all substrings in s: {check_substring(s, 'li', 'gr', 'te', True)}\")\nTypeError: 'in &lt;string&gt;' requires string as left operand, not bool\nPython interpreted False as being part of the *substrings argument. It expected a string but instead got a bool (and it was not happy). When we use *, all succeeding positional arguments are assumed to be part of the same set (in this case, substrings). That’s why all the remaining arguments must be passed using keywords.\nWe could remove the default value for all_strings, then it’d be a required (rather than optional) keyword-only argument.\n** collects all the optional keyword-only arguments into a dictionary. With **, there is no need to specify all keywords that have default values. The code will be more concise as a result.\n\ndef get_connection_string(self, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Get the connection string for a database\"\"\"\n    con_string = f\"{kwargs.get('user')}:{kwargs.get('password')}\\\n        @{kwargs.get('host')}/{kwargs.get('myschema')}\"\n\n    return con_string\n\nWe have now covered four types of arguments.\n\n\n\nLabel\nArgument Type\n\n\n\n\n1\nPositional arguments\n\n\n2\nTuple of positional arguments\n\n\n3\nKeyword-only arguments\n\n\n4\nDictionary of optional keyword arguments\n\n\n\n# parg: Positional argument\n# kwarg: Keyword arguments\n\ndef function_with_all_argument_types(\n    #&lt;----  1  ----&gt;\n    arg1, arg2, ..., \n\n    #&lt;- 2 -&gt;\n    *args, \n\n    #&lt;------ 3 -------&gt;\n    kwarg1, kwarg2, ..., \n\n    #&lt;-- 4 --&gt;\n    **kwargs\n    )\n    return"

    "text": "The plan was straightforward: train hard for seven weeks, rest for one, and finish with five weeks of sharpening. It didn’t stay simple for long.\nI followed a focused but demanding schedule: - Mon: Club - Tue: Gym Strength - Wed: Club - Thu: Club - Fri: Gym Explosive - Sat: Rest - Sun: Footwork & Technique\nAt DCU Boxing Club, Derek, Colin, and Terry run the sessions. Between them, they’ve decades of experience, working with all levels, from novices to Olympians. Derek likes to say, “Boxing shows you who you are.” Colin likes to test your limits. And if you ask Terry what he thinks of boxing, he might say, “tough sport”. They’ve a real passion for boxing and are dedicated to helping us develop our skills.\nClub sessions followed a familiar pattern – warm up, shadow boxing, technical skills in school sparring, and drilling combinations on (seemingly endless) rounds of bag work. Finally, we put it all together in open sparring. “Finally” you thought? Oh no, do your skipping and core work first, then you’re free to go.\nFor me, club sessions were a high priority. I aimed to show up well-fuelled, ready to work, and with a positive attitude.\nThis plan was more intense than I was used to. Managing stress and training load, both inside and outside the gym, became critical. Each week, I’d look ahead at what I had planned and see if I needed to make any adjustments.\nI set myself one rule: no more than two hard spars a week. But it was tricky; on good nights, I was eager to get in and on bad ones, I didn’t want to look like I was ducking out.\nI logged each session after leaving the gym. I learned early that writing out each session was gruelling, so I switched to ChatGPT voice notes. I’d ramble through each session and ask it to give a breakdown of what worked, what didn’t, and a focus for the next session.\nThe gym work was simple but deliberate – everything needed to transfer to boxing. Tuesdays were for strength: squats, deadlifts, pull-ups and shoulder press, keeping reps low. Fridays kept the movements but swapped weight for speed, incorporating jumping squats and deadlifts, sternum-to-bar pull-ups, and the landmine press, which I liked, especially for improving foot, hip, and torso coordination.\nSundays were at my own pace. I explored and played with new techniques and footwork, and finished with cardio. Early in camp, I did steady-state, and later on, I’d perform sprints.\nAfter each session, I always stretched for at least 5 minutes. The small habit made a big difference, I felt looser and less sore across the week.\nThe first few weeks went to plan – six sessions a week, knocking them off one by one. I felt stronger, my skills were sharpening, and I started using mental visualisation during sparring with mixed success. The training load was heavy, but I believed I was managing it.\nThings kicked off in week 4 with our first external spar of the year – a chance to blow off the cobwebs. External spars are of a higher intensity. They’re not real fight intensity, but there’s no friendly familiarity. Most gyms ban filming to protect boxers’ privacy. It’s a pity, you can learn a thing or two from watching the spars back. The night before, I did a deload gym session to make sure I was fresh for Cabra. I usually avoid small tweaks, but external spars were a priority.\nWednesday, January 22nd, 19:30, we arrived in Cabra BC. I stepped through the ropes and looked across the ring at a stocky 80+ kg lad, staring me down and ready to rock— Oh Jaysus, here we go. From the get-go, he switched between throwing bombs on the inside (nearly took my head off) and gliding around on the outside.\nThe second opponent was taller and longer, someone I’d fought before. He had a high work rate, and his shots were clean. I stayed composed, blocked plenty, but it was clear my conditioning needed work.\nAs I left, I noticed my second opponent still on the bags, practicing combinations. For him, the session wasn’t over yet.\nThe very next day at the club, I sparred again. Third spar of the week – breaking my rule. Two rounds in, I was sluggish, static, and getting hit far too often. I felt angry at myself over the decision to get in. But after talking with the coach, I realised that while sparring mightn’t have been the best call, you don’t always get the luxury of perfect conditions.\nA week later, on Wednesday in Mulhuddart BC, I felt sharper. Two bigger opponents, but both at my weight – one dangerous on the inside, the other slick and elusive on the outside. I controlled distance better, countered cleanly, and spotted openings I’d missed before. I left happy, and my coach was too.\nCherry Orchard BC was a different story. The following evening we were melting getting into the ring. The ceiling heating turned the place into a sauna. I was first in, switching between one southpaw and one orthodox opponent. Each change confused me, and I took too long to adapt.  But with the southpaw, when I finally parried his jab and fired mine through, it landed. Afterwards, my coach told me to stop waiting – take control early,  dictate the pace, and don’t let the opponent settle into a rhythm. Throw first and throw often. I left the ring wrecked, but still finished the session with three rounds on the bags and four rounds skipping.\nComing into the February Bank Holiday weekend, I was drained from the two external spars and heavy training during the week. In my explosive session on Friday, I focused on speed by halving weight. After resting Saturday, I was back with the footwork and cardio on Sunday, followed by a late-night event, where I didn’t get home until 3 am. Still, I trained Monday as usual and had a strong strength session Tuesday, hitting new weights on all lifts.\nIn Mulhuddart on Wednesday, I sparred with the same two guys. One had figured me out – closed the distance fast and kept the pressure high. Against the other, I worked the body and added second-phase attacks. While I caught most shots on my guard, I took a few hard shots as well.\nBy the end of Week 5, I’d banked 30 sessions: 7 club, 4 external spars, 8 technical/footwork, and 11 gym.\nOn paper, things looked great! In reality, I was edging towards the red. My plan to mitigate the risks of overtraining had held so far. But as Eisenhower said,\n\nPlans are worthless, planning is everything.\n\nOr in Mike Tyson’s words\n\nEveryone has a plan until they get hit in the face.\n\nAnd I, had been hit in the face. Tune in next week to see how that plan panned out."

    "text": "💡  What type of people do you work well with?         When pursuing your goals, do your expectations usually meet reality?         What are your career priorities and how do they impact your quality of life?\n\nINTRA (INtegrated TRAining) placement was a breath of fresh air after the events of the previous semester. I looked forward to intriguing work and being part of a team. However, I held concerns about the working environment. Growing up, media often depicted a bleak view of the professional world, featuring burnt-out employees, horrible bosses, and draining work, think of Fight Club, Horrible Bosses, or Mad Men.\nWhile I recognised these portrayals were exaggerated for effect, I worried about any underlying truths echoed by anecdotal evidence I had gathered over the years. I wondered, would my manager be a narcissistic, egomaniac!? Would the culture be so competitive and toxic that everyone saw each other as instruments to be used for their gain!? Would the work be so mind-numbing that I would wake up every morning before work thinking, “Oh no, not again!”?\nFortunately, I had worked with the company in a previous internship and any concerns I had proved to be unfounded. People were collaborative rather than competitive. We worked together and helped each other out. I valued the office setting for the spontaneous discussions that wouldn’t have been possible remotely from home. During lunch, engaging conversations with the team ranged from personal experiences to ongoing projects. Post-work meet-ups always had a crowd making it easier to meet people and get to know them better. I had the autonomy to think of ideas and turn them into projects. I made the most of opportunities to present work and practice my public speaking skills.\nManagement invested time into developing people on the team and shared their expertise without ego. They were humble and listened to the team’s feedback.

    "text": "💡  What type of people do you work well with?         When pursuing your goals, do your expectations usually meet reality?         What are your career priorities and how do they impact your quality of life?\n\nINTRA (INtegrated TRAining) placement was a breath of fresh air after the events of the previous semester. I looked forward to intriguing work and being part of a team. However, I held concerns about the working environment. Growing up, media often depicted a bleak view of the professional world, featuring burnt-out employees, horrible bosses, and draining work, think of Fight Club, Horrible Bosses, or Mad Men.\nWhile I recognised these portrayals were exaggerated for effect, I worried about any underlying truths echoed by anecdotal evidence I had gathered over the years. I wondered, would my manager be a narcissistic, egomaniac!? Would the culture be so competitive and toxic that everyone saw each other as instruments to be used for their gain!? Would the work be so mind-numbing that I would wake up every morning before work thinking, “Oh no, not again!”?\nFortunately, I had worked with the company in a previous internship and any concerns I had proved to be unfounded. People were collaborative rather than competitive. We worked together and helped each other out. I valued the office setting for the spontaneous discussions that wouldn’t have been possible remotely from home. During lunch, engaging conversations with the team ranged from personal experiences to ongoing projects. Post-work meet-ups always had a crowd making it easier to meet people and get to know them better. I had the autonomy to think of ideas and turn them into projects. I made the most of opportunities to present work and practice my public speaking skills.\nManagement invested time into developing people on the team and shared their expertise without ego. They were humble and listened to the team’s feedback. The company, being a startup that lacked a large hierarchical structure, avoided office politics and popularity contests, at least from what I could observe. Though, through past experiences, I’ve realised that organisational politics is more about the leadership than it is about the company’s size.\nAll in all, I realised my luck with where I worked.

Reflecting on my first year, it dawned on me that I’d dedicated an awful lot of time to studying. I worried that my future self might regret not having indulged in the “full college experience.” At the time, I believed university fun mainly revolved around drinking and partying. So, naturally, I figured if I wanted to have more fun, I should drink and party more while leaving hard stuff like studying, working out, and meal prep to the waist side. And that’s exactly what I did. I found myself attending regular house parties and drinking.\nOver time, I started feeling a sense of freedom, thinking I was finally “letting loose” and truly getting “the full college experience.” But then came a turning point. One night, running late for a party, I decided to “catch up”. So, I downed a shoulder of vodka and pure orange and pineapple mi-wadi. Due to a system memory corruption error, I’m unable to give specific details of what occurred after, nor would I want to. The main thing is the following day was the worst I had ever felt physically. I didn’t attend lectures and just lay in bed feeling miserable and sorry for myself.\nFollowing that episode, I reflected on the past few weeks and had a real wake-up call. My new lifestyle left me feeling more drained, anxious, irritable, unfocused, and scattered than ever before. My workouts stagnated, and my academic work suffered. So, I asked myself:\n\nDiarmuid, I don’t like this. I feel like shit. Why am I doing it?\n\n\nBecause this is fun. It might be difficult, but this is fun, right?\n\nNo. No, it was not. I was chasing what I thought others found fun, trying to fit into their idea of a good time. But truth be told, this wasn’t fun for me. What I truly enjoyed was getting up early (7 am), diving into study and programming, going to the gym or rock climbing, cooking proper meals, hanging out with friends and family, watching movies and TV series, reading, listening to music, exploring new places, and going to bed early (10 pm).\nBe careful not to conflate other people’s idea of fun as what you find fun. When you’re in the middle of what’s supposed to be a great time, take a mental note of how much you’re genuinely enjoying it. Separate the hype from your experience.\nAs the semester drew to a close, I tried to make up for lost time. I did alright, but I knew there was room for improvement. I desired a change.

    "section": "Mia and Sebastian’s Theme - La La Land, Manny and Nellie’s Theme - Babylon (Justin Hurwitz)",
    "text": "Mia and Sebastian’s Theme - La La Land, Manny and Nellie’s Theme - Babylon (Justin Hurwitz)\nJustin Hurwitz is one of my favourite film score composers and often collaborates with director Damien Chazelle. Chazelle believes a film’s score is as important as the characters and plot when making a film. I appreciate his approach, as you can learn a lot from listening to his film’s music in isolation.\nTwo of Chazelle’s films, La La Land and Babylon, share a common theme of unrequited love. The romantic themes include “Mia and Sebastian” (La La Land) and “Manny and Nellie” (Babylon). The name order may indicate the character’s importance. I believe Mia and Manny are the true protagonists of their respective films. I want to explore the similarities and contrasts between their themes as reflected in the relationships.\nMia and Sebastian’s theme is romantic, warm, and sad. The piece ends chaotically, emphasising the relationship’s unsustainable nature. Manny and Nellie’s theme consists of a crazy, romantic melody that complements the story’s tone and the era in which it is set. Its wistful and melancholic quality also illustrates the relationship’s impracticality.\nBoth relationships are built upon the two characters’ shared drive to follow their dreams. In La La Land, there is a line: “Here is to one’s who dream, foolish as they may seem.” In Babylon, Manny says, “I always wanted to be part of something bigger. Something that lasts, that means something.” Hope is a sentiment that often accompanies dreams. But as I listen to their themes, I only hear hopelessness.\nMia and Sebastian’s theme is filled with peaks and troughs, like a roller coaster of hope and disappointment that runs off track. The eloquence and depth in their theme contrast with Manny and Nellie’s carefree and raw tone. This disparity highlights the frivolity of the Babylon relationship but also the lower socioeconomic status of its characters.\nI want ChatGPT to compare these two themes and how they reflect the traits of both relationships.\n\n\nMy Prompt\n\n*Imagine you are a film score and soundtrack expert who has an undying passion for analysing the meaning behind the music composed for movies and films. You are an avid fan of the work of Damien Chazelle and Justin Hurwitz, and in particular, you have a deep understanding of the relationships between Mia and Sebastian in La La Land and Manny and Nellie in Babylon.\nI want you to compare the similarities and differences between the two pieces of music, “Mia and Sebastian’s Theme” and “Manny and Nellie’s Theme.” Discuss how each theme contributes to and reflects the characters’ relationships in each movie.*\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\nAs a film score and soundtrack expert, I would be thrilled to discuss the music of Damien Chazelle and Justin Hurwitz, particularly the similarities and differences between the themes of two romantic relationships, Mia and Sebastian in La La Land and Manny and Nellie in Babylon.\nFirstly, let’s talk about “Mia and Sebastian’s Theme” from La La Land. This beautiful piece of music is the signature tune of the film, featuring a tender romantic melody played on piano with a simple, repetitive accompaniment. The music reflects the dreamy, whimsical quality of Mia and Sebastian’s relationship as they fall in love and pursue their respective artistic passions. The theme perfectly captures the bittersweet essence of their love story as they try to navigate their professional ambitions and their feelings for each other.\nOn the other hand, “Manny and Nellie’s Theme” from Babylon has a different vibe. The music is more melancholic, with a haunting melody played on strings and woodwinds. This theme reflects the intense, tragic nature of Manny and Nellie’s relationship, which is defined by their struggles with addiction and the harsh realities of life on the streets. The music conveys a sense of hopelessness and despair, as well as a deep emotional connection between the two characters, who are united by their shared experiences.\nDespite the differences between the two themes, there are some similarities in the way that they contribute to and reflect the characters’ relationships in each movie. Both themes are used as leitmotifs throughout the films, appearing in different variations and arrangements to underscore key moments in the story. They also serve as a musical shorthand for the character’s emotions and relationships, allowing the audience to connect with them on a deeper level.\nIn summary, “Mia and Sebastian’s Theme” and “Manny and Nellie’s Theme” are two beautiful pieces of music that reflect the complex, nuanced relationships between the characters in their respective films. While they have different musical styles and tonalities, they both serve as powerful tools to convey the emotions and experiences of the characters and to draw the audience into their world.\n\nChatGPT exceeded my expectations by providing a more accurate summary of the two themes and relationships in each movie. ChatGPT points out the themes’ differences in musical styles and tonalities. Words such as ‘dreamy’, ‘bittersweet’, and ‘tragic’ elegantly describe the themes. I felt these words on the tip of my tongue, but I couldn’t think of them. ChatGPT exhibits precise word use. I appreciated how ChatGPT uses terminology like leitmotifs and eloquently communicates a point like ‘serve as a musical shorthand for the characters’ emotions and relationships.’ ChatGPT has delivered a remarkable piece of writing and showcases the ability to craft impressive cinematic commentary."

In many cases, ChatGPT is right. But when it is wrong, a novice wouldn’t possess the understanding or skills to check its validity. That is my primary concern. Not that ChatGPT can be wrong, but that you’d struggle to identify it.\nGiven these considerations, ChatGPT’s true strength lies in assisting those who already have subject matter knowledge. It’s powerful when trying to organise thoughts into structured, coherent ideas."

    "text": "Introduction\nChatGPT has become a subject of intense controversy. Views on this large language model (LLM) range widely, some see it as a powerful tool for the future of learning while others fear it will stifle innovation and creativity. One significant question is “can we rely on a Generative Artificial Intelligence’s (GAI) expertise on niche subject matters?” Like any technology, there are benefits and drawbacks. On the one hand it appears to be knowledgeable in many domains. However, ChatGPT is also known for hallucinating (stating nonfactual information with great certainty), putting its credibility into question.\nTo address this, I am evaluating ChatGPT’s knowledge on a topic I’m passionate about: film scores and their impact on the cinematic experience.\nFor this analysis, I focus on three genres; thriller, action and romance.

    "section": "Why Do We Fall - The Dark Knight Rises (Hans Zimmer)",
    "text": "Why Do We Fall - The Dark Knight Rises (Hans Zimmer)\nWhy Do We Fall is among my favourite pieces of film music. The title is half of a line of dialogue given by Alfred to Bruce in the Dark Knight Rises.\n\nWhy do we fall Mr. Wayne? So we can learn to pick ourselves up.\n\nThe musical piece captures Bruce’s rise from The Pit at the end of the second act, on his return to save Gotham. The climb involves a long ascent up the pit wall with a final jump to a ledge at the top to secure his escape.\nThe music begins with strings as Bruce approaches the wall to make his climb. In the film, this is accompanied by a chant by the fellow inmates which translated means ‘rise’. As Bruce ascends the wall, the music intensifies and pace quickens using the brass’s power and the percussion’s rhythmic drive. As he makes the final leap of faith to escape, the music comes to a crescendo with a cliffhanging pause. In previous attempts to escape, Bruce fell short before the ledge causing him to fall. But this time he succeeds and the music reciprocates his redemption through a powerful finish.\nThematically, Bruce’s rise from the pit symbolises a pivotal moment in his physical and emotional character development for how he faces adversity. He not only regains his physical strength but also learns to embrace fear as a potent driver to escape the pit.\nThe drums mirror his heart beat. At the beginning, they are calm like Bruce. As he rises up the wall, the drums become more powerful, akin to his elevating heart rate and his acceptance of fear. The moment before the jump is when the drums and his heart rate are most intense and he feels the greatest fear. This fear is what drives him to successfully land the jump.\n\n\nMy Prompt\n\nImagine you are a film score and soundtrack expert who has an undying passion for analysing the meaning behind the music composed for movies and films.\nCould you discuss the meaning behind the piece ‘Why Do We Fall?’ and how Hans Zimmer combines specific musical instruments/sounds to communicate this meaning?\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\nAbsolutely! “Why Do We Fall?” is a powerful piece of music composed by Hans Zimmer for the movie The Dark Knight Rises. It is an instrumental track that plays during some of the most emotional and pivotal moments of the film. Let’s explore its meaning and importance.\nFirst, it’s essential to note that “Why Do We Fall?” is a recurring motif throughout the entire Dark Knight trilogy. It first appears in Batman Begins during the scene where Bruce Wayne is training to become Batman. This piece of music signifies Bruce’s struggle to overcome his fears and become the hero that Gotham needs.\nIn The Dark Knight Rises, “Why Do We Fall?” takes on a new significance. The film opens with Bruce Wayne broken and defeated, having lost everything he held dear. This track plays during the scene where Bruce is trying to climb out of the prison he’s trapped in. The music serves to underscore his struggle to overcome his physical and emotional limitations, and ultimately, his triumph over them. This theme is woven throughout the film, as Bruce Wayne, now physically and emotionally broken, must find a way to rise up and save Gotham once again.\nIn many ways, “Why Do We Fall?” is the heart of The Dark Knight Rises. It represents the film’s central theme of perseverance and the idea that even when we fall, we must get back up and keep fighting. This message is particularly poignant in light of the film’s release, which came shortly after the tragic shooting in Aurora, Colorado. The film’s message of hope in the face of adversity resonated with audiences, and “Why Do We Fall?” became a rallying cry for those seeking to find meaning in the wake of tragedy.\nIn conclusion, “Why Do We Fall?” is a powerful piece of music that encapsulates the themes of perseverance and hope that are central to The Dark Knight Rises. Its importance lies not just in its use in the film but also in the way it has become a symbol of resilience and strength for audiences around the world.\n\nFor this prompt, I wanted ChatGPT to discuss not only the piece of music, but also its role in the trilogy. It identified the moment it was played during the rise from the pit, followed by discussing broadly, the thematic meaning behind the phrase and how it relates to the character of Bruce Wayne himself. I am very happy with this response as it addressed the key points I was focusing on; how Bruce not only has the physical struggle of escaping the pit but also has the emotional limitation of accepting fear.\nI was surprised by its mention of the Colorado shooting. The film’s impact on society was not a focus of my question. This emphasises the need for precise language when interacting with ChatGPT.\nI had expected ChatGPT would comment on how drums mimic Bruce’s heartbeat beginning at rest and then building up as the scene grows in intensity. After a second prompt asking “In the musical piece, I believe the drum mirrors Bruce’s heartbeat. Can you discuss this Idea?” ChatGPT responded in agreement, elaborating how the drum mimicking a heartbeat is a common technique used in film scores to build tension and enhance the audience’s experience."

    "section": "Taking A Stand - Captain America: The Winter Soldier (Henry Jackman)",
    "text": "Taking A Stand - Captain America: The Winter Soldier (Henry Jackman)\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier is my favourite movie. In this movie, Captain America (Steve Rogers) struggles to find his footing in the modern world after being under the ice for 70 years. While coming to terms with this new world, he uncovers unsettling secrets about the people he had once laid down his life for. The composition “Taking a Stand” accompanies the pivotal scene when Steve is on the run from S.H.I.E.L.D. They cast him as a traitor after he finds out about Hydra’s roots within S.H.I.E.L.D’s organisation and pursues what he believes is right. This is a key moment in the Winter Soldier and Steve’s character arc across the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This scene builds upon the scene in Captain America: The First Avenger when he disobeys direct orders against infiltrating the Hydra base to free his captured comrades. Steve exercises his own judgement and continues the path to becoming an independent character with his own set of values. We see this come to a head in Captain America: Civil War when he opposes the Sokovia Accords. I expect ChatGPT to discuss these key motifs and themes.\n\n\nMy Prompt\n\nImagine you are a film score and soundtrack expert who has an undying passion for analysing the meaning behind the music composed for movies and films. You have studied the character of Steve Rogers (Captain America) specifically in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nI want you to discuss the importance of the piece of music “Taking a Stand” in Captain America: The Winter Soldier for forwarding the plot and the role it plays in developing Steve’s character arc in the MCU.\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\nAs a film score and soundtrack expert, I can confidently say that music plays a vital role in shaping the emotional impact of a movie or film. The piece of music “Taking a Stand” from Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a perfect example of how music can forward the plot while also contributing to the character development of the protagonist, Steve Rogers.\nThe piece of music “Taking a Stand” is a recurring theme throughout the film, representing the heroic nature of Captain America and his unwavering dedication to standing up for what is right. The music is first introduced during the opening action sequence, where Steve, aka Captain America, and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D agents rescue hostages from pirates on the Lemurian Star. The music sets the tone for the rest of the film, establishing Captain America as a symbol of hope and justice.\nThroughout the film, we see Steve struggling to reconcile his old-fashioned values with the complex and morally ambiguous world he finds himself in. He is forced to question his loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D. and the government and faces betrayal from those he once trusted. The music “Taking a Stand” serves as a reminder of his unwavering moral compass and his commitment to standing up for what is right, even in the face of adversity.\nIn the film’s climactic scene, where Steve and his friend Sam Wilson confront the Winter Soldier, the music swells to a crescendo, emphasising the gravity of the situation and the high stakes involved. The music is a testament to Steve’s growth as a character, showing how he has evolved from a simple soldier to a true leader who inspires those around him to do the right thing.\nIn conclusion, the piece of music “Taking a Stand” is a critical element of Captain America: The Winter Soldier’s soundtrack, both forwarding the plot and contributing to the development of Steve’s character arc. The music serves as a powerful reminder of Steve’s unwavering dedication to standing up for what is right, even in the face of impossible odds, making him a true hero and an inspiration to audiences worldwide.\n\nChatGPT begins by agreeing with me about the importance of the piece of music. Unfortunately, ChatGPT misses that “Taking a Stand” is a distinct piece that accompanies a specific action sequence in the film. Instead, ChatGPT takes “Taking a Stand” as more of a musical theme and reflection of Steve’s character traits. “Taking a Stand” is not introduced in the opening scene, “Lemurian Star” is. It is not played in the final scene either.\nChatGPT is not recognising “Taking a Stand” as a standalone piece of music and instead as a broader theme in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. This is disappointing. A standalone composition in an action movie is rare. Action music is usually formulaic, echoing familiar patterns.\nChatGPT comments that the music illustrates Steve’s character growth “from a simple soldier to a true leader”. This is a hallmark of his character. Let’s explore this further.\n\n\nSecond Prompt\n\nCan you give examples of unwavering dedication to standing up for what is right, even in the face of impossible odds from the whole Trilogy and how the role the piece of music “Taking a Stand” (played during his escape from the S.H.I.E.L.D. compound) plays among these examples.”\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\n*Certainly, there are several examples throughout the Captain America Trilogy that demonstrate Steve Rogers’ unwavering dedication to standing up for what is right, even in the face of impossible odds.\nOne such example is in Captain America: The First Avenger, where Steve, despite being physically weak and frail, repeatedly tries to enlist in the military to fight in World War II. His persistence and determination eventually lead him to be selected for a top-secret government experiment that turns him into the super-soldier Captain America. The music “Taking a Stand” is not present in this film, but we can see how Steve’s unwavering dedication is a constant theme throughout his journey.\nAnother example is in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, where Steve becomes disillusioned with S.H.I.E.L.D.’s actions and uncovers a conspiracy within the organisation. Despite facing seemingly insurmountable odds, Steve decides to take a stand against those who would use their power for personal gain, ultimately leading to the collapse of S.H.I.E.L.D. The piece of music “Taking a Stand” plays during Steve’s escape from the S.H.I.E.L.D. compound, emphasising the gravity of the situation and the stakes involved. The music also highlights Steve’s determination to do what is right, even if it means going against authority figures he once trusted.\nIn Captain America: Civil War, Steve once again finds himself at odds with his former teammates in the Avengers, who have aligned themselves with the government’s demands for accountability. Despite being on the run and facing a powerful new enemy, Steve remains committed to his beliefs and refuses to compromise his principles. The piece of music “Taking a Stand” plays during the final battle between Steve and Iron Man, underscoring the emotional weight of the confrontation and Steve’s conviction in his actions.\nIn conclusion, the piece of music “Taking a Stand” serves as a recurring theme throughout the Captain America Trilogy, emphasising Steve Rogers’ unwavering dedication to standing up for what is right, even in the face of seemingly impossible odds. From his persistence in enlisting in the military to his fight against corrupt organisations, Steve’s commitment to his beliefs is a constant thread throughout his journey, and the music serves as a powerful reminder of his heroism and bravery.”*\n\nI’m satisfied with this response. ChatGPT provides examples from each movie of Captain America’s independence and integrity. It identifies its presence in The Winter Solider, and absence in The First Avenger, but it makes a mistake with when it says it was in the final battle of Captain America: Civil War. The final battle scene was underscored by the piece “Clash”. In this analysis, ChatGPT describes how a soundtrack impacts character themes but struggles with placing the sountrack in the right moment of the film. Saying it another way, ChatGPT can describe niche topics subjectively but not precisely. Niche topics lack training data. Therefore, performance on precise, complex tasks lags in these areas. This is the crux of the hallucination problem. For subjective questions, there is no true right answer and ChatGPT can get away with “waffling”. But questions with only one true answer stifle ChatGPT. We can demonstrate this when posing complex maths problems to ChatGPT. There is almost always error. It’s plausible to attribute this to its stochastic nature."

    "text": "💡  What do you believe confidence is?         What people, activities or situations impact your confidence either positively or negatively?         Do you believe you could improve your confidence?\n\nIn my final semester, I had no big plans. I aimed to stick with the clubs and societies I enjoyed, finish my coursework, and leave college content. At the start of the semester, there was talk about a boxing intervarsity competition, which seemed both thrilling and daunting. I lacked experience, and the idea of participating felt like a losing battle, I thought I’d get killed! Yet, as the weeks passed, I diligently worked on the basics as I learned in Semester 4, growing more comfortable in my form and sparring skills. On February 10th, I committed to entering the competition, with just five weeks to prepare. I weighed around 74kg, fighting in the 69kg weight class. Cutting 5kg in 5 weeks felt like a formidable task as I had no prior experience. I gathered insights from podcasts produced by the nutritionist I worked with in Semester 4. They addressed using a calorie tracker, implementing a mini-cut, and understanding the satiety index. I synthesised this information into a 5-week plan. To ensure my approach was sound, I reached out to my nutritionist, who approved my strategy but suggested fight week protocols to drop an extra 1-2kg if needed.\nMy plan revolved around three key principles:\n\nMaintain a calorie deficit to lose weight.\nConsume high-satiety foods to curb hunger.\nEnsure sufficient protein intake to preserve muscle.\n\nI made these specific changes:\n\nCalorie cut from 2750 to 1750 daily. I calculated this using the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Weight Planner.\nDaily protein intake at 1.5-2g per kilogram body weight. Focused on chicken, turkey, egg whites and powdered whey.\nIncreased intake of filling fruits and non-starchy vegetables.\nOpted for high-satiety carbohydrates like potatoes and oats.\nMade low-calorie swaps like low-fat milk, 1-calorie spray and low-cal sauces.\nDrank water and coffee in the morning to offset hunger\nTracked calories by weighing all food items.\nAvoided highly palatable food like chocolates and sweets.\n\nMy weekly training involved:\n\n3 boxing sessions\n2-3 gym and sprint sessions\nyoga and gymnastics for fun and relaxation\n\nInitially, everything went well, I made progress in training and the diet didn’t seem to both me too much. However, after three weeks, my energy plummeted, leading to constant fatigue and hunger. This affected my thoughts and emotions, creating a cycle of food preoccupation. Despite this, I felt unexpectedly resilient. I believed I could tackle any challenge I set my mind to, fostering a sense of confidence I hadn’t anticipated.\nOn the day of my first fight, I found myself still above the required weight (69kg). After spending an hour in the sauna (15 minutes at a time), I finally made weight, bringing a sigh of relief. Following that, I rehydrated and prepared myself both mentally and physically by focusing on my fight plan and doing warm-up exercises. When it was my turn, I entered the ring feeling focused rather than nervous. I was reserved and tense initially, but as the fight progressed, I became more aggressive, landing more powerful shots and gaining control. It was clear I was the stronger opponent and I won by unanimous decision.\nI had reached the All-Ireland Intervarsity final against an opponent, boasting greater experience, speed, and agility. This showdown was scheduled two weeks ahead. During this period, I closely studied his bouts, strategising with my coach to counter his style. Doubtful thoughts lingered in my mind about his superiority over me. However, learning from Semester 5, I let go of any expectations I had of winning, allowing me to dedicate my focus to training and mental preparation.\nWhen the fight day arrived, I was ready. I had managed to cut my weight to 69kg during the week, making the weigh-in effortless. I warmed up and performed pad work with my coach. My name was called out and I made my way up to the ring. Stepping into the ring, my face was greased with Vaseline, gloves were snug on my wrists, and the head guard was fixed to my head. I geared up for the face-off, the referee outlined the rules, we tapped gloves and we returned to our respective corners.\nDing-ding! Round 1 — I moved out aggressively. I cornered my opponent, poised to land heavy blows, but he evaded swiftly to the side. Undeterred, I pushed him into the next corner and he dodged again. And a third time, BOOM! He countered with a lead hook, caught me off guard and knocked me off balance. I fell against the ropes and I got a standing count. This cat and mouse continued, with him dodging and countering many of my shots. I felt I was off to a bad start. Returning to my corner, I was advised to relax the power and throw shots more frequently.\nDing-ding! Round 2 — The next round saw me quickly moving out, with a more relaxed form, I let my jab go more often. I became better at closing the gap and wearing him down.

As the referee grasped both our hands, the judges began to speak. I mentally prepared for defeat by telling myself I had lost and that it was all okay.

    "text": "💡  What do you believe confidence is?         What people, activities or situations impact your confidence either positively or negatively?         Do you believe you could improve your confidence?\n\nIn my final semester, I had no big plans. I aimed to stick with the clubs and societies I enjoyed, finish my coursework, and leave college content. At the start of the semester, there was talk about a boxing intervarsity competition, which seemed both thrilling and daunting. I lacked experience, and the idea of participating felt like a losing battle, I thought I’d get killed! Yet, as the weeks passed, I diligently worked on the basics as I learned in Semester 4, growing more comfortable in my form and sparring skills. On February 10th, I committed to entering the competition, with just five weeks to prepare. I weighed around 74kg, fighting in the 69kg weight class. Cutting 5kg in 5 weeks felt like a formidable task as I had no prior experience. I gathered insights from podcasts produced by the nutritionist I worked with in Semester 4. They addressed using a calorie tracker, implementing a mini-cut, and understanding the satiety index. I synthesised this information into a 5-week plan. To ensure my approach was sound, I reached out to my nutritionist, who approved my strategy but suggested fight week protocols to drop an extra 1-2kg if needed.\nMy plan revolved around three key principles:\n\nMaintain a calorie deficit to lose weight.\nConsume high-satiety foods to curb hunger.\nEnsure sufficient protein intake to preserve muscle.\n\nI made these specific changes:\n\nCalorie cut from 2750 to 1750 daily. I calculated this using the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Weight Planner.\nDaily protein intake at 1.5-2g per kilogram body weight. Focused on chicken, turkey, egg whites and powdered whey.\nIncreased intake of filling fruits and non-starchy vegetables.\nOpted for high-satiety carbohydrates like potatoes and oats.\nMade low-calorie swaps like low-fat milk, 1-calorie spray and low-cal sauces.\nDrank water and coffee in the morning to offset hunger\nTracked calories by weighing all food items.\nAvoided highly palatable food like chocolates and sweets.\n\nMy weekly training involved:\n\n3 boxing sessions\n2-3 gym and sprint sessions\nyoga and gymnastics for fun and relaxation\n\nInitially, everything went well, I made progress in training and the diet didn’t seem to both me too much. However, after three weeks, my energy plummeted, leading to constant fatigue and hunger. This affected my thoughts and emotions, creating a cycle of food preoccupation. Despite this, I felt unexpectedly resilient. I believed I could tackle any challenge I set my mind to, fostering a sense of confidence I hadn’t anticipated.\nOn the day of my first fight, I found myself still above the required weight (69kg). After spending an hour in the sauna (15 minutes at a time), I finally made weight, bringing a sigh of relief. Following that, I rehydrated and prepared myself both mentally and physically by focusing on my fight plan and doing warm-up exercises. When it was my turn, I entered the ring feeling focused rather than nervous. I was reserved and tense initially, but as the fight progressed, I became more aggressive, landing more powerful shots and gaining control. It was clear I was the stronger opponent and I won by unanimous decision.\nI had reached the All-Ireland Intervarsity final against an opponent, boasting greater experience, speed, and agility. This showdown was scheduled two weeks ahead. During this period, I closely studied his bouts, strategising with my coach to counter his style. Doubtful thoughts lingered in my mind about his superiority over me. However, learning from Semester 5, I let go of any expectations I had of winning, allowing me to dedicate my focus to training and mental preparation.\nWhen the fight day arrived, I was ready. I had managed to cut my weight to 69kg during the week, making the weigh-in effortless. I warmed up and performed pad work with my coach. My name was called out and I made my way up to the ring. Stepping into the ring, my face was greased with Vaseline, gloves were snug on my wrists, and the head guard was fixed to my head. I geared up for the face-off, the referee outlined the rules, we tapped gloves and we returned to our respective corners.\nDing-ding! Round 1 — I moved out aggressively. I cornered my opponent, poised to land heavy blows, but he evaded swiftly to the side. Undeterred, I pushed him into the next corner and he dodged again. And a third time, BOOM! He countered with a lead hook, caught me off guard and knocked me off balance. I fell against the ropes and I got a standing count. This cat and mouse continued, with him dodging and countering many of my shots. I felt I was off to a bad start. Returning to my corner, I was advised to relax the power and throw shots more frequently.\nDing-ding! Round 2 — The next round saw me quickly moving out, with a more relaxed form, I let my jab go more often. I became better at closing the gap and wearing him down. As I noticed his guard drop, I landed my shots. The momentum began to shift. After the second round, I returned to my corner, seeking more advice. Sensing his fatigue, I stood up early, eager to show my tenacity.\nDing-ding! Round 3 — Once more, I charged forward, controlling the space, making it clear I was driven to win.

At a pivotal moment, I managed to pin him against the ropes, launching a combination of shots. Sensing his mental fatigue, I battled to wear him down entirely, I pursued him relentlessly until the final bell.\nThe final bell rang and I returned to my coaches who were cheering.

    "text": "Conclusion\n\nYou can’t connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backward. - Steve Jobs\n\nReflecting on the past four years of my life has been a meaningful endeavour. What once felt like mistakes to be forgotten have transformed into pivotal moments of my story. Without them, I wouldn’t possess the insights I do today. This realisation reinforces the idea that mistakes aren’t an obstacle to growth; they are an essential ingredient. Steve Jobs’ quote recognises that clarity is often not gained until you stop and take time to look back. Looking ahead, I feel confident about placing myself in situations where I’m likely to make mistakes, recognising the opportunities for learning they bring.\nI firmly believe that one’s response to life events matters more than the events themselves. This perspective acknowledges that challenges are inevitable but you always have the power to take control of your life instead of letting externalities dictate it. In this process, self-reflection serves as an invaluable tool, allowing you to integrate and embrace your past mistakes.\nNow, I invite you to contemplate the three greatest mistakes in your life. Write out your experiences before and after each mistake and how they impacted you. Carry out a brainstorming session to extract lessons from each mistake. Write down any and all types of lessons—this will be eye-opening. Another takeaway from Jobs is that you can connect the dots however you see fit. Initially, I thought I had eight lessons ready to go, but after a comprehensive brainstorm, I generated 176, this means I had 22 sets of lessons to choose from. The key is to strike a balance between specificity (tailored to the event) and generalisability (applicable to various aspects of life).\nAs you select lessons for this series, prioritise honesty, accuracy, and coherence. Post-brainstorm, reframe your experiences through the lens of the lessons learned. Consider how your actions contributed to learning the lesson rather than making the mistake, reframing the narrative. Subsequently, redraft and edit your work into a cohesive story.\nTo embrace self-reflection, identify your mistakes, focus on the lessons learned and start writing."

In secondary school, I often spent considerable time alone. Yet, in college, it was a whirlwind of meeting people—everywhere I turned, someone new awaited.\nWhether in campus accommodation, clubs, societies, house parties, or during nights out, the initial semester revolved around encountering fresh faces nearly every day.

    "text": "When I was younger, a recurring phrase I often heard was, “Your college years are some of the best years of your life.” Me being me, I took this assertion quite seriously. If college was significantly valuable, I was determined to seize every opportunity it presented. I adopted an iterative approach, leveraging my experiences from past semesters alongside advice I received from others to inform my approach to each subsequent term.\nUpon reflection, I find this approach similar to a subsection of Artificial Intelligence called Reinforcement Learning, a concept ironically inspired by human learning. In this analogy, I acted as the Agent, navigating college life, which served as the Environment with each semester being each time step T. The beginning of each semester marked the State. My actions within each semester comprised the Action. The strategy I adopted each term became the Policy. How I felt at the term’s conclusion represented the Reward. Meanwhile, my expected emotional state, given a particular strategy within a semester, resembled the Value Function. My introspective process at the end of each semester mirrored the workings of a Learning Algorithm (my brain, I suppose).\nSimilar to any reinforcement learning algorithm, I had to find a balance between exploration (trying new things) and exploitation (sticking with what I knew). Throughout the first three years, I struggled to find what was right for me. But, with some persistent experimentation and self-reflection, I managed to find my place. I learned one key lesson from each semester, culminating in eight lessons that I intend to share across eight blog posts over the next eight weeks (credit to Deborah for that idea).\nEach year of my college experience revolved around a specific theme: Year 1 focused on Relationships, Year 2 delved into Lifestyle, Year 3 centred on Career, and Year 4 encapsulated Growth, bringing together aspects from the previous three years.\nMy aspiration with these posts is that they are valuable. I hope that reading about the lessons I’ve learned from my life can help you in navigating yours. To support your self-reflection, I’ll share three introspective questions each week that I asked myself at the time of learning each lesson. By answering these questions honestly, you may uncover blind spots that have been holding you back in surprising ways."

    "text": "In June 2024, we had a small dinner with the DCU boxing club, one of the lads was moving abroad, and I found myself sitting across from Oran, my club mate and sparring partner. We reflected on the season with mixed feelings about our performances.\nI had entered the Porto Box Cup at 71kg and had lost my opening fight against a bigger, more skilled opponent who went on to win the tournament.\nDespite losing our respective competitions, Oran and I believed that with focused preparation, we could return next year and compete at the level we knew we were capable of.\nI kept training 3 to 5 times a week, testing new techniques in sparring and exhibitions throughout the summer and into the autumn.\nIn September 2024, I had an exhibition in Manchester that left a mark. It was my first stoppage, where the fight was ended early because I was being overpowered. Last-minute changes before the bout threw me. I entered the ring scattered and tense, my thoughts in a frenzy. My performance reflected that state, and the disappointment stung. I’d hoped the fight would show my progress. Instead, it exposed my shortcomings.\nAfterwards, I sat down wondering how I’d lost composure so quickly. Over the following days, it became clear that mental preparation mattered just as much as physical. If I couldn’t maintain composure under pressure, I wouldn’t perform, like shooting a cannon from a canoe. I doubted whether I could handle pressure at all, if I was someone who always caved.\nI began learning about sports psychology and how athletes like Michael Phelps used mental rehearsal to prepare for the unexpected, like his goggles filling with water during the 2008 Olympics final, and still went on to win gold and break the world record.\nIn November, I started a mental visualisation practice to help me stay composed when things didn’t go to plan. I wanted to build the kind of mindset that could hold steady under pressure, to manage fear and get the job done, no matter what came up.\nOver Christmas, I took a complete rest from training, as I had finished an aggressive weight cut in the start of December and I needed time to recover. At a family dinner on New Year’s Day, boxing came up. Before I knew it, I said “I’m aiming to win the Porto Box Cup in April.”\nSaying it out loud reinforced it and made the decision real. I’d always wanted to pursue something ambitious in sport. But until now, nothing had stuck. Boxing was different. It offered a chance to test myself physically and mentally, with no excuses.\nIn the past, I often told myself I’d ‘try my best.’ But in hindsight, I realised I wasn’t aiming to succeed; I was playing it safe. This time, I was fully committed, no half measures. I wanted to win. Porto felt like it was just within arm’s reach, and I believed with the right preparation, I could produce a performance I’d be proud of.\nAt the heart of it, this is the story of pursuing a meaningful goal, one that invigorates and intimidates you. It either pulls you forward or quietly lingers until you’ve done something about it.\nThis is part one of a 10-part series, released weekly, tracing the twists and turns as they unfolded.\nOn January 2nd, the countdown began. I had 13 weeks. Next week’s post picks up from there. I’ll walk through the first five weeks, where the plan started to take shape, and how early progress gave me confidence.\nIn the meantime, think about one meaningful goal you’ve pursued before.\n\nWhat made it meaningful?\nWhat was at stake for you, personally?\nHow did it change you?"
