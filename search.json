    "text": "When I was younger, a recurring phrase I often heard was, “Your college years are some of the best years of your life.” Me being me, I took this assertion quite seriously. If college was significantly valuable, I was determined to seize every opportunity it presented. I adopted an iterative approach, leveraging my experiences from past semesters alongside advice I received from others to inform my approach to each subsequent term.\nUpon reflection, I find this approach similar to a subsection of Artificial Intelligence called Reinforcement Learning, a concept ironically inspired by human learning. In this analogy, I acted as the Agent, navigating college life, which served as the Environment with each semester being each time step T. The beginning of each semester marked the State. My actions within each semester comprised the Action. The strategy I adopted each term became the Policy. How I felt at the term’s conclusion represented the Reward. Meanwhile, my expected emotional state, given a particular strategy within a semester, resembled the Value Function. My introspective process at the end of each semester mirrored the workings of a Learning Algorithm (my brain, I suppose).\nSimilar to any reinforcement learning algorithm, I had to find a balance between exploration (trying new things) and exploitation (sticking with what I knew). Throughout the first three years, I struggled to find what was right for me. But, with some persistent experimentation and self-reflection, I managed to find my place. I learned one key lesson from each semester, culminating in eight lessons that I intend to share across eight blog posts over the next eight weeks (credit to Deborah for that idea).\nEach year of my college experience revolved around a specific theme: Year 1 focused on Relationships, Year 2 delved into Lifestyle, Year 3 centred on Career, and Year 4 encapsulated Growth, bringing together aspects from the previous three years.\nMy aspiration with these posts is that they are valuable. I hope that reading about the lessons I’ve learned from my life can help you in navigating yours. To support your self-reflection, I’ll share three introspective questions each week that I asked myself at the time of learning each lesson. By answering these questions honestly, you may uncover blind spots that have been holding you back in surprising ways."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nChatGPT has become a subject of intense controversy. Views on this large language model (LLM) range widely, some see it as a powerful tool for the future of learning while others fear it will stifle innovation and creativity. One significant question is “can we rely on a Generative Artificial Intelligence’s (GAI) expertise on niche subject matters?” Like any technology, there are benefits and drawbacks. On the one hand it appears to be knowledgeable in many domains. However, ChatGPT is also known for hallucinating (stating nonfactual information with great certainty), putting its credibility into question.\nTo address this, I am evaluating ChatGPT’s knowledge on a topic I’m passionate about: film scores and their impact on the cinematic experience.\nFor this analysis, I focus on three genres; thriller, action and romance. While characters, themes, and plot are commonly discussed aspects of a film but a film’s soundtrack is overlooked and underappreciated.\nBy following along with this three part series, you’ll develop a brief understanding of:\n\nChatGPT’s strengths and weaknesses.\nA film soundtrack’s role in cinema."

    "section": "Why Do We Fall - The Dark Knight Rises (Hans Zimmer)",
    "text": "Why Do We Fall - The Dark Knight Rises (Hans Zimmer)\nWhy Do We Fall is among my favourite pieces of film music. The title is half of a line of dialogue given by Alfred to Bruce in the Dark Knight Rises.\n\nWhy do we fall Mr. Wayne? So we can learn to pick ourselves up.\n\nThe musical piece captures Bruce’s rise from The Pit at the end of the second act, on his return to save Gotham. The climb involves a long ascent up the pit wall with a final jump to a ledge at the top to secure his escape.\nThe music begins with strings as Bruce approaches the wall to make his climb. In the film, this is accompanied by a chant by the fellow inmates which translated means ‘rise’. As Bruce ascends the wall, the music intensifies and pace quickens using the brass’s power and the percussion’s rhythmic drive. As he makes the final leap of faith to escape, the music comes to a crescendo with a cliffhanging pause. In previous attempts to escape, Bruce fell short before the ledge causing him to fall. But this time he succeeds and the music reciprocates his redemption through a powerful finish.\nThematically, Bruce’s rise from the pit symbolises a pivotal moment in his physical and emotional character development for how he faces adversity. He not only regains his physical strength but also learns to embrace fear as a potent driver to escape the pit.\nThe drums mirror his heart beat. At the beginning, they are calm like Bruce. As he rises up the wall, the drums become more powerful, akin to his elevating heart rate and his acceptance of fear. The moment before the jump is when the drums and his heart rate are most intense and he feels the greatest fear. This fear is what drives him to successfully land the jump.\n\n\nMy Prompt\n\nImagine you are a film score and soundtrack expert who has an undying passion for analysing the meaning behind the music composed for movies and films.\nCould you discuss the meaning behind the piece ‘Why Do We Fall?’ and how Hans Zimmer combines specific musical instruments/sounds to communicate this meaning?\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\nAbsolutely! “Why Do We Fall?” is a powerful piece of music composed by Hans Zimmer for the movie The Dark Knight Rises. It is an instrumental track that plays during some of the most emotional and pivotal moments of the film. Let’s explore its meaning and importance.\nFirst, it’s essential to note that “Why Do We Fall?” is a recurring motif throughout the entire Dark Knight trilogy. It first appears in Batman Begins during the scene where Bruce Wayne is training to become Batman. This piece of music signifies Bruce’s struggle to overcome his fears and become the hero that Gotham needs.\nIn The Dark Knight Rises, “Why Do We Fall?” takes on a new significance. The film opens with Bruce Wayne broken and defeated, having lost everything he held dear. This track plays during the scene where Bruce is trying to climb out of the prison he’s trapped in. The music serves to underscore his struggle to overcome his physical and emotional limitations, and ultimately, his triumph over them. This theme is woven throughout the film, as Bruce Wayne, now physically and emotionally broken, must find a way to rise up and save Gotham once again.\nIn many ways, “Why Do We Fall?” is the heart of The Dark Knight Rises. It represents the film’s central theme of perseverance and the idea that even when we fall, we must get back up and keep fighting. This message is particularly poignant in light of the film’s release, which came shortly after the tragic shooting in Aurora, Colorado. The film’s message of hope in the face of adversity resonated with audiences, and “Why Do We Fall?” became a rallying cry for those seeking to find meaning in the wake of tragedy.\nIn conclusion, “Why Do We Fall?” is a powerful piece of music that encapsulates the themes of perseverance and hope that are central to The Dark Knight Rises. Its importance lies not just in its use in the film but also in the way it has become a symbol of resilience and strength for audiences around the world.\n\nFor this prompt, I wanted ChatGPT to discuss not only the piece of music, but also its role in the trilogy. It identified the moment it was played during the rise from the pit, followed by discussing broadly, the thematic meaning behind the phrase and how it relates to the character of Bruce Wayne himself. I am very happy with this response as it addressed the key points I was focusing on; how Bruce not only has the physical struggle of escaping the pit but also has the emotional limitation of accepting fear.\nI was surprised by its mention of the Colorado shooting. The film’s impact on society was not a focus of my question. This emphasises the need for precise language when interacting with ChatGPT.\nI had expected ChatGPT would comment on how drums mimic Bruce’s heartbeat beginning at rest and then building up as the scene grows in intensity. After a second prompt asking “In the musical piece, I believe the drum mirrors Bruce’s heartbeat. Can you discuss this Idea?” ChatGPT responded in agreement, elaborating how the drum mimicking a heartbeat is a common technique used in film scores to build tension and enhance the audience’s experience."

    "text": "💡  Have you ever tried to improve yourself using elaborate or esoteric changes?         Were you satisfied with the results?         Have you managed to stick with those changes? \n\nThis semester was pivotal. It was the final term before my grades factored into my final mark, and I was determined to be well-prepared. I wanted to avoid reaching my third year without a plan for improving my grades. I aimed to be ready, so I devised a plan: establish a consistent sleep routine, study hard, and train hard.\nThis plan didn’t work very well. It was hard to stick to. I was trying to improve everything all at once and as a result, I made an initial change but then quickly fell off. I felt tired during workouts, and my study sessions lacked productivity. I needed a better strategy. I hypothesised that making incremental habitual changes in sleep, exercise, nutrition, and study would collectively improve my overall grades. But I lacked the knowledge to implement these changes effectively and I needed help.\nHaving followed a few online coaches for some years, I got a lot of value from their philosophy and practical guidance on training and life. Consequently, I reached out to a strength coach and a nutritionist, shared my goals and sought their guidance.\nGradually, I introduced various changes. I tracked my sleep using an app, incorporated aids like a sleep mask and earplugs to ensure complete darkness and silence (two vital factors of sleep hygiene), put a wind-down routine in place between 9 pm and 10 pm to fall asleep faster, and began my morning with a walk.\nIn terms of nutrition, I planned meals weekly, cooked in bulk, tracked calories, ate more fruit and veg, increased my protein intake and drank around 2.8 litres daily (~40ml per kg bodyweight). I practised mindful eating with chocolate several times a week to improve my relationship with food. I prioritised stopping when I felt full instead of bingeing food.\nOn the exercise front, I structured two upper body, two lower body, and one full body mobility session weekly, and dedicated ten minutes daily to moving each joint.\nRegarding study, I planned each week, chose a distraction-free study space, and focused on one topic at a time for two-hour blocks, aiming for three sessions per day (occasionally adjusting to four or two blocks depending on how I felt).\nTo unwind, I relaxed in the evenings with friends and made the most of the weekends by going on trips to explore new places.\nTackling two or three habits at a time over several weeks made the process less daunting. Seeking advice from my coaches when questions arose significantly eased the process and without them, I would have struggled to make the progress I did.\nWith the changes in place, I felt great physically, mentally, and emotionally. Notably, my sleep and nutrition improved substantially, boosting my overall energy levels. My training progressed remarkably, and my study sessions became highly productive. Most importantly, my average grade saw a 9% increase, which at the time, meant everything!\nIt became evident that improving an aspect of my life relied upon the basics. I hadn’t done anything crazy, I had simply adopted several small habit changes and sustained them over time.\nIf you want to improve your life, focus on making small changes that produce great returns. Often, the most impactful changes are basic and are observed over the long term, such as consistent darkness for your sleep, daily movement for your body or intense focus for your work. The real challenge lies in deciphering what you can adhere to consistency as part of your daily life.\nEntering my third year, I felt ready. I had put in the work and it had paid off. While I maintained my class ranking, I believed I could do better. But you know what they say, “Man plans, and God laughs.” Join me next week to discover how my grand plan unfolded and whether I set the right goals in the first place."

I prioritised stopping when I felt full instead of bingeing food.\nOn the exercise front, I structured two upper body, two lower body, and one full body mobility session weekly, and dedicated ten minutes daily to moving each joint.\nRegarding study, I planned each week, chose a distraction-free study space, and focused on one topic at a time for two-hour blocks, aiming for three sessions per day (occasionally adjusting to four or two blocks depending on how I felt).\nTo unwind, I relaxed in the evenings with friends and made the most of the weekends by going on trips to explore new places.\nTackling two or three habits at a time over several weeks made the process less daunting. Seeking advice from my coaches when questions arose significantly eased the process and without them, I would have struggled to make the progress I did.\nWith the changes in place, I felt great physically, mentally, and emotionally. Notably, my sleep and nutrition improved substantially, boosting my overall energy levels. My training progressed remarkably, and my study sessions became highly productive. Most importantly, my average grade saw a 9% increase, which at the time, meant everything!\nIt became evident that improving an aspect of my life relied upon the basics. I hadn’t done anything crazy, I had simply adopted several small habit changes and sustained them over time.\nIf you want to improve your life, focus on making small changes that produce great returns. Often, the most impactful changes are basic and are observed over the long term, such as consistent darkness for your sleep, daily movement for your body or intense focus for your work. The real challenge lies in deciphering what you can adhere to consistency as part of your daily life.\nEntering my third year, I felt ready. I had put in the work and it had paid off. While I maintained my class ranking, I believed I could do better. But you know what they say, “Man plans, and God laughs.” Join me next week to discover how my grand plan unfolded and whether I set the right goals in the first place."

    "text": "💡  What is your idea of fun?         Do you believe spending time having fun is important?         How much time do you spend having fun? \n\nI kicked off my second year with one goal in mind—to have as much fun as I possibly could. Reflecting on my first year, it dawned on me that I’d dedicated an awful lot of time to studying. I worried that my future self might regret not having indulged in the “full college experience.” At the time, I believed university fun mainly revolved around drinking and partying. So, naturally, I figured if I wanted to have more fun, I should drink and party more while leaving hard stuff like studying, working out, and meal prep to the waist side. And that’s exactly what I did. I found myself attending regular house parties and drinking.\nOver time, I started feeling a sense of freedom, thinking I was finally “letting loose” and truly getting “the full college experience.” But then came a turning point. One night, running late for a party, I decided to “catch up”. So, I downed a shoulder of vodka and pure orange and pineapple mi-wadi. Due to a system memory corruption error, I’m unable to give specific details of what occurred after, nor would I want to. The main thing is the following day was the worst I had ever felt physically. I didn’t attend lectures and just lay in bed feeling miserable and sorry for myself.\nFollowing that episode, I reflected on the past few weeks and had a real wake-up call. My new lifestyle left me feeling more drained, anxious, irritable, unfocused, and scattered than ever before. My workouts stagnated, and my academic work suffered. So, I asked myself:\n\nDiarmuid, I don’t like this. I feel like shit. Why am I doing it?\n\n\nBecause this is fun. It might be difficult, but this is fun, right?\n\nNo. No, it was not. I was chasing what I thought others found fun, trying to fit into their idea of a good time. But truth be told, this wasn’t fun for me. What I truly enjoyed was getting up early (7 am), diving into study and programming, going to the gym or rock climbing, cooking proper meals, hanging out with friends and family, watching movies and TV series, reading, listening to music, exploring new places, and going to bed early (10 pm).\nBe careful not to conflate other people’s idea of fun as what you find fun. When you’re in the middle of what’s supposed to be a great time, take a mental note of how much you’re genuinely enjoying it. Separate the hype from your experience.\nAs the semester drew to a close, I tried to make up for lost time. I did alright, but I knew there was room for improvement. I desired a change. In the next semester, I delved deep into topics like self-development and behaviour change. I had ranked third in my class, but I began to wonder—if I pushed myself, could I reach second or even first place?"

    "text": "💡  What do you believe confidence is?         What people, activities or situations impact your confidence either positively or negatively?         Do you believe you could improve your confidence?\n\nIn my final semester, I had no big plans. I aimed to stick with the clubs and societies I enjoyed, finish my coursework, and leave college content. At the start of the semester, there was talk about a boxing intervarsity competition, which seemed both thrilling and daunting. I lacked experience, and the idea of participating felt like a losing battle, I thought I’d get killed! Yet, as the weeks passed, I diligently worked on the basics as I learned in Semester 4, growing more comfortable in my form and sparring skills. On February 10th, I committed to entering the competition, with just five weeks to prepare. I weighed around 74kg, fighting in the 69kg weight class. Cutting 5kg in 5 weeks felt like a formidable task as I had no prior experience. I gathered insights from podcasts produced by the nutritionist I worked with in Semester 4. They addressed using a calorie tracker, implementing a mini-cut, and understanding the satiety index. I synthesised this information into a 5-week plan. To ensure my approach was sound, I reached out to my nutritionist, who approved my strategy but suggested fight week protocols to drop an extra 1-2kg if needed.\nMy plan revolved around three key principles:\n\nMaintain a calorie deficit to lose weight.\nConsume high-satiety foods to curb hunger.\nEnsure sufficient protein intake to preserve muscle.\n\nI made these specific changes:\n\nCalorie cut from 2750 to 1750 daily. I calculated this using the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Weight Planner.\nDaily protein intake at 1.5-2g per kilogram body weight. Focused on chicken, turkey, egg whites and powdered whey.\nIncreased intake of filling fruits and non-starchy vegetables.\nOpted for high-satiety carbohydrates like potatoes and oats.\nMade low-calorie swaps like low-fat milk, 1-calorie spray and low-cal sauces.\nDrank water and coffee in the morning to offset hunger\nTracked calories by weighing all food items.\nAvoided highly palatable food like chocolates and sweets.\n\nMy weekly training involved:\n\n3 boxing sessions\n2-3 gym and sprint sessions\nyoga and gymnastics for fun and relaxation\n\nInitially, everything went well, I made progress in training and the diet didn’t seem to both me too much. However, after three weeks, my energy plummeted, leading to constant fatigue and hunger. This affected my thoughts and emotions, creating a cycle of food preoccupation. Despite this, I felt unexpectedly resilient. I believed I could tackle any challenge I set my mind to, fostering a sense of confidence I hadn’t anticipated.\nOn the day of my first fight, I found myself still above the required weight (69kg). After spending an hour in the sauna (15 minutes at a time), I finally made weight, bringing a sigh of relief. Following that, I rehydrated and prepared myself both mentally and physically by focusing on my fight plan and doing warm-up exercises. When it was my turn, I entered the ring feeling focused rather than nervous. I was reserved and tense initially, but as the fight progressed, I became more aggressive, landing more powerful shots and gaining control. It was clear I was the stronger opponent and I won by unanimous decision.\nI had reached the All-Ireland Intervarsity final against an opponent, boasting greater experience, speed, and agility. This showdown was scheduled two weeks ahead. During this period, I closely studied his bouts, strategising with my coach to counter his style. Doubtful thoughts lingered in my mind about his superiority over me. However, learning from Semester 5, I let go of any expectations I had of winning, allowing me to dedicate my focus to training and mental preparation.\nWhen the fight day arrived, I was ready. I had managed to cut my weight to 69kg during the week, making the weigh-in effortless. I warmed up and performed pad work with my coach. My name was called out and I made my way up to the ring. Stepping into the ring, my face was greased with Vaseline, gloves were snug on my wrists, and the head guard was fixed to my head. I geared up for the face-off, the referee outlined the rules, we tapped gloves and we returned to our respective corners.\nDing-ding! Round 1 — I moved out aggressively. I cornered my opponent, poised to land heavy blows, but he evaded swiftly to the side. Undeterred, I pushed him into the next corner and he dodged again. And a third time, BOOM! He countered with a lead hook, caught me off guard and knocked me off balance. I fell against the ropes and I got a standing count. This cat and mouse continued, with him dodging and countering many of my shots. I felt I was off to a bad start. Returning to my corner, I was advised to relax the power and throw shots more frequently.\nDing-ding! Round 2 — The next round saw me quickly moving out, with a more relaxed form, I let my jab go more often. I became better at closing the gap and wearing him down. As I noticed his guard drop, I landed my shots. The momentum began to shift. After the second round, I returned to my corner, seeking more advice. Sensing his fatigue, I stood up early, eager to show my tenacity.\nDing-ding! Round 3 — Once more, I charged forward, controlling the space, making it clear I was driven to win. I watched his evasions become slower and more predictable. Despite feeling exhausted, I disguised it by keeping on the front foot. At a pivotal moment, I managed to pin him against the ropes, launching a combination of shots. Sensing his mental fatigue, I battled to wear him down entirely, I pursued him relentlessly until the final bell.\nThe final bell rang and I returned to my coaches who were cheering. I asked them “Is that it? Is it over?”, my coach laughed, “Ye, it’s over…are you alright???”, “Ye I’m fine, I just want to know I can relax.” After removing my head guard, gloves, and gum shield, I approached the centre stage. As the referee grasped both our hands, the judges began to speak. I mentally prepared for defeat by telling myself I had lost and that it was all okay. But my hand was raised and I surged with joy as I claimed sweet victory. It was an electrifying moment, the culmination of tireless effort finally swinging in my favour.\nExiting the ring, I proudly accepted my All-Ireland medal and hugged my coach, who shared my triumph. I returned to my family who shared my glee. On the way back in the car, I spoke to my brother saying “You know it’s strange, doing this has been the most exhausting thing I’ve ever done but I’ve never felt calmer inside.” He told me he had noticed it too.\nMonths of intense training aimed at a singular goal had unexpectedly built a newfound confidence that manifested as a feeling of calmness. It was like stepping into a quiet room for the first time, where once, there had always been a buzzing noise. I realised that confidence was less about grandeur or and more about easing anxiety and finding comfort within oneself. If you want to build confidence, I believe in aiming for something challenging and meaningful. Then, pursue it with all you have."

I geared up for the face-off, the referee outlined the rules, we tapped gloves and we returned to our respective corners.\nDing-ding! Round 1 — I moved out aggressively. I cornered my opponent, poised to land heavy blows, but he evaded swiftly to the side. Undeterred, I pushed him into the next corner and he dodged again. And a third time, BOOM! He countered with a lead hook, caught me off guard and knocked me off balance. I fell against the ropes and I got a standing count. This cat and mouse continued, with him dodging and countering many of my shots. I felt I was off to a bad start. Returning to my corner, I was advised to relax the power and throw shots more frequently.\nDing-ding! Round 2 — The next round saw me quickly moving out, with a more relaxed form, I let my jab go more often. I became better at closing the gap and wearing him down. As I noticed his guard drop, I landed my shots. The momentum began to shift. After the second round, I returned to my corner, seeking more advice. Sensing his fatigue, I stood up early, eager to show my tenacity.\nDing-ding! Round 3 — Once more, I charged forward, controlling the space, making it clear I was driven to win. I watched his evasions become slower and more predictable. Despite feeling exhausted, I disguised it by keeping on the front foot. At a pivotal moment, I managed to pin him against the ropes, launching a combination of shots. Sensing his mental fatigue, I battled to wear him down entirely, I pursued him relentlessly until the final bell.\nThe final bell rang and I returned to my coaches who were cheering. I asked them “Is that it? Is it over?”, my coach laughed, “Ye, it’s over…are you alright???”, “Ye I’m fine, I just want to know I can relax.” After removing my head guard, gloves, and gum shield, I approached the centre stage. As the referee grasped both our hands, the judges began to speak. I mentally prepared for defeat by telling myself I had lost and that it was all okay. But my hand was raised and I surged with joy as I claimed sweet victory. It was an electrifying moment, the culmination of tireless effort finally swinging in my favour.\nExiting the ring, I proudly accepted my All-Ireland medal and hugged my coach, who shared my triumph. I returned to my family who shared my glee. On the way back in the car, I spoke to my brother saying “You know it’s strange, doing this has been the most exhausting thing I’ve ever done but I’ve never felt calmer inside.” He told me he had noticed it too.\nMonths of intense training aimed at a singular goal had unexpectedly built a newfound confidence that manifested as a feeling of calmness. It was like stepping into a quiet room for the first time, where once, there had always been a buzzing noise. I realised that confidence was less about grandeur or and more about easing anxiety and finding comfort within oneself. If you want to build confidence, I believe in aiming for something challenging and meaningful. Then, pursue it with all you have."

    "text": "Conclusion\n\nYou can’t connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backward. - Steve Jobs\n\nReflecting on the past four years of my life has been a meaningful endeavour. What once felt like mistakes to be forgotten have transformed into pivotal moments of my story. Without them, I wouldn’t possess the insights I do today. This realisation reinforces the idea that mistakes aren’t an obstacle to growth; they are an essential ingredient. Steve Jobs’ quote recognises that clarity is often not gained until you stop and take time to look back. Looking ahead, I feel confident about placing myself in situations where I’m likely to make mistakes, recognising the opportunities for learning they bring.\nI firmly believe that one’s response to life events matters more than the events themselves. This perspective acknowledges that challenges are inevitable but you always have the power to take control of your life instead of letting externalities dictate it. In this process, self-reflection serves as an invaluable tool, allowing you to integrate and embrace your past mistakes.\nNow, I invite you to contemplate the three greatest mistakes in your life. Write out your experiences before and after each mistake and how they impacted you. Carry out a brainstorming session to extract lessons from each mistake. Write down any and all types of lessons—this will be eye-opening. Another takeaway from Jobs is that you can connect the dots however you see fit. Initially, I thought I had eight lessons ready to go, but after a comprehensive brainstorm, I generated 176, this means I had 22 sets of lessons to choose from. The key is to strike a balance between specificity (tailored to the event) and generalisability (applicable to various aspects of life).\nAs you select lessons for this series, prioritise honesty, accuracy, and coherence. Post-brainstorm, reframe your experiences through the lens of the lessons learned. Consider how your actions contributed to learning the lesson rather than making the mistake, reframing the narrative. Subsequently, redraft and edit your work into a cohesive story.\nTo embrace self-reflection, identify your mistakes, focus on the lessons learned and start writing."

    "section": "Taking A Stand - Captain America: The Winter Soldier (Henry Jackman)",
    "text": "Taking A Stand - Captain America: The Winter Soldier (Henry Jackman)\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier is my favourite movie. In this movie, Captain America (Steve Rogers) struggles to find his footing in the modern world after being under the ice for 70 years. While coming to terms with this new world, he uncovers unsettling secrets about the people he had once laid down his life for. The composition “Taking a Stand” accompanies the pivotal scene when Steve is on the run from S.H.I.E.L.D. They cast him as a traitor after he finds out about Hydra’s roots within S.H.I.E.L.D’s organisation and pursues what he believes is right. This is a key moment in the Winter Soldier and Steve’s character arc across the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This scene builds upon the scene in Captain America: The First Avenger when he disobeys direct orders against infiltrating the Hydra base to free his captured comrades. Steve exercises his own judgement and continues the path to becoming an independent character with his own set of values. We see this come to a head in Captain America: Civil War when he opposes the Sokovia Accords. I expect ChatGPT to discuss these key motifs and themes.\n\n\nMy Prompt\n\nImagine you are a film score and soundtrack expert who has an undying passion for analysing the meaning behind the music composed for movies and films. You have studied the character of Steve Rogers (Captain America) specifically in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nI want you to discuss the importance of the piece of music “Taking a Stand” in Captain America: The Winter Soldier for forwarding the plot and the role it plays in developing Steve’s character arc in the MCU.\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\nAs a film score and soundtrack expert, I can confidently say that music plays a vital role in shaping the emotional impact of a movie or film. The piece of music “Taking a Stand” from Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a perfect example of how music can forward the plot while also contributing to the character development of the protagonist, Steve Rogers.\nThe piece of music “Taking a Stand” is a recurring theme throughout the film, representing the heroic nature of Captain America and his unwavering dedication to standing up for what is right. The music is first introduced during the opening action sequence, where Steve, aka Captain America, and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D agents rescue hostages from pirates on the Lemurian Star. The music sets the tone for the rest of the film, establishing Captain America as a symbol of hope and justice.\nThroughout the film, we see Steve struggling to reconcile his old-fashioned values with the complex and morally ambiguous world he finds himself in. He is forced to question his loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D. and the government and faces betrayal from those he once trusted. The music “Taking a Stand” serves as a reminder of his unwavering moral compass and his commitment to standing up for what is right, even in the face of adversity.\nIn the film’s climactic scene, where Steve and his friend Sam Wilson confront the Winter Soldier, the music swells to a crescendo, emphasising the gravity of the situation and the high stakes involved. The music is a testament to Steve’s growth as a character, showing how he has evolved from a simple soldier to a true leader who inspires those around him to do the right thing.\nIn conclusion, the piece of music “Taking a Stand” is a critical element of Captain America: The Winter Soldier’s soundtrack, both forwarding the plot and contributing to the development of Steve’s character arc. The music serves as a powerful reminder of Steve’s unwavering dedication to standing up for what is right, even in the face of impossible odds, making him a true hero and an inspiration to audiences worldwide.\n\nChatGPT begins by agreeing with me about the importance of the piece of music. Unfortunately, ChatGPT misses that “Taking a Stand” is a distinct piece that accompanies a specific action sequence in the film. Instead, ChatGPT takes “Taking a Stand” as more of a musical theme and reflection of Steve’s character traits. “Taking a Stand” is not introduced in the opening scene, “Lemurian Star” is. It is not played in the final scene either.\nChatGPT is not recognising “Taking a Stand” as a standalone piece of music and instead as a broader theme in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. This is disappointing. A standalone composition in an action movie is rare. Action music is usually formulaic, echoing familiar patterns.\nChatGPT comments that the music illustrates Steve’s character growth “from a simple soldier to a true leader”. This is a hallmark of his character. Let’s explore this further.\n\n\nSecond Prompt\n\nCan you give examples of unwavering dedication to standing up for what is right, even in the face of impossible odds from the whole Trilogy and how the role the piece of music “Taking a Stand” (played during his escape from the S.H.I.E.L.D. compound) plays among these examples.”\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\n*Certainly, there are several examples throughout the Captain America Trilogy that demonstrate Steve Rogers’ unwavering dedication to standing up for what is right, even in the face of impossible odds.\nOne such example is in Captain America: The First Avenger, where Steve, despite being physically weak and frail, repeatedly tries to enlist in the military to fight in World War II. His persistence and determination eventually lead him to be selected for a top-secret government experiment that turns him into the super-soldier Captain America. The music “Taking a Stand” is not present in this film, but we can see how Steve’s unwavering dedication is a constant theme throughout his journey.\nAnother example is in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, where Steve becomes disillusioned with S.H.I.E.L.D.’s actions and uncovers a conspiracy within the organisation. Despite facing seemingly insurmountable odds, Steve decides to take a stand against those who would use their power for personal gain, ultimately leading to the collapse of S.H.I.E.L.D. The piece of music “Taking a Stand” plays during Steve’s escape from the S.H.I.E.L.D. compound, emphasising the gravity of the situation and the stakes involved. The music also highlights Steve’s determination to do what is right, even if it means going against authority figures he once trusted.\nIn Captain America: Civil War, Steve once again finds himself at odds with his former teammates in the Avengers, who have aligned themselves with the government’s demands for accountability. Despite being on the run and facing a powerful new enemy, Steve remains committed to his beliefs and refuses to compromise his principles. The piece of music “Taking a Stand” plays during the final battle between Steve and Iron Man, underscoring the emotional weight of the confrontation and Steve’s conviction in his actions.\nIn conclusion, the piece of music “Taking a Stand” serves as a recurring theme throughout the Captain America Trilogy, emphasising Steve Rogers’ unwavering dedication to standing up for what is right, even in the face of seemingly impossible odds. From his persistence in enlisting in the military to his fight against corrupt organisations, Steve’s commitment to his beliefs is a constant thread throughout his journey, and the music serves as a powerful reminder of his heroism and bravery.”*\n\nI’m satisfied with this response. ChatGPT provides examples from each movie of Captain America’s indepedence and integrity. It identifies its presence in The Winter Solider, and absence in The First Avenger, but it makes a mistake with when it says it was in the final battle of Captain America: Civil War. The final battle scene was underscored by the piece “Clash”. In this analysis, ChatGPT describes how a soundtrack impacts character themes but struggles with placing the sountrack in the right moment of the film. Saying it another way, ChatGPT can describe niche topics subjectively but not precisely. Niche topics lack training data. Therefore, performance on precise, complex tasks lags in these areas. This is the crux of the hallucination problem. For subjective questions, there is no true right answer and ChatGPT can get away with “waffling”. But questions with only one true answer stifle ChatGPT. We can demonstrate this when posing complex maths problems to ChatGPT. There is almost always error. It’s plausible to attribute this to its stochastic nature."
