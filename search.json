    "text": "When you observe masters of any skill, they always have a strong grasp of the fundamentals.\nBut when we’re learning new skills, we’re eager to move on to the most exciting areas. We get distracted by the attractive parts of the skill, we neglect the simple basics, and this stunts our progress. I believe that to master any skill, you must continually refine the basics because the highest peak has the strongest base.\nPython was a large aspect of my BSc in Data Science. I’ve continued to strengthen my basics through internships, personal projects, and in my current job. However, I’ve noticed I’ve become habitual in my choice of tools, using the same knowledge repeatedly. The course, “Python For Data Science, AI & Development” on Coursera, exposed the gaps in my knowledge and refreshed my understanding of the core topics."

    "text": "Escape \\ the SyntaxError !\nWhen working with strings, the escape character \\ (backslash) is a handy way to include special characters in your strings. The backslash changes the meaning of the next character. You can also avoid syntax errors by using the backslash!\nIn Python, apostrophes and quotation marks must come in pairs. Unpaired quotation marks create syntax errors. The example below returns a syntax error because the apostrophe in “friend’s” is unmatched.\nprint('Jimmy borrowed his friend's phone')\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)\nTo solve this dilemma, use one of the following:\n# Just use double quotes silly!\nprint(\"Jimmy borrowed his friend's phone.\")\n\n# Triple single quotes to allow multi-line strings.\nprint('''\nJimmy borrowed his friend's phone.\n''')\n                                            \n# Triple double quotes if I'm feeling fancy ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n# Or if it's a docstring as per PEP 257\nprint(\"\"\"\nJimmy borrowed his friend's phone.\n\"\"\")\nBut wait! There’s one more I had forgotten about…the escape character.\n\nprint('Jimmy borrowed his friends\\'s phone.')\n\nJimmy borrowed his friends's phone.\n\n\nVoilà! Problem solved. For the record, double quotes is my preference for greater readability.\n\nThere are many escape characters, including \\t (tab space), \\n (newline) and \\'. Another escape character is the carriage return, \\r. It moves the cursor to the start of the current line and proceeds to overwrite the text.\nNow you can create the cool loading symbol that appears when installing a library from Pip or Conda!\nRun the following code in a Python file, and you’ll see the loading symbol on the right.\n\n\nimport time\n\nloading = ['|', '/', '-', '\\\\']\nfor i in range(50):\n    print(f\"{loading[i % len(loading)]}\\r\")\n    time.sleep(0.2)"

    "text": "get() rid of the KeyError!\nDictionaries are one of my favourite data structures in Python. They are intuitive, useful, and efficient. After creating a dictionary, you can add, update, or delete key-value pairs. Please see the code example below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColour or color? That is the question.\n\n\n\nI write colour as color when coding Python because the language is written in American English as opposed to UK English. I thought I would point this out before the grammar police get me!\n\n\n\n# Create the dictionary using empty curly brackets.\ndict_color_code = {}\n\n# Add a key-value pair using square brackets of white and the hex color code\ndict_color_code['white'] = '#FFFFFF'\n\n# Find the hex color code of white using square brackets\nprint(f\"White hex color code: {dict_color_code['white']}\")\n\n# Let's update the value for white\ndict_color_code['white'] = '#F8F6F0'\n\nprint(f\"New value for white: {dict_color_code['white']}\")\n\n# Now let's remove white\n# Pop will return the value of the key 'white'\ndict_color_code.pop('white')\n\nWhite hex color code: #FFFFFF\nNew value for white: #F8F6F0\n\n\n'#F8F6F0'\n\n\nAbove, I demonstrated the basic actions of the dictionary. We finished by deleting the key we had created. Now let’s try to fetch that key-value.\n# Check that white is not there\nprint(dict_color_code['white'])\nKeyError: 'white'\nImagine that I want to avoid this error. I could check if the key is in the dictionary first:\n\nk = 'white'\nif k in dict_color_code:\n    print(dict_color_code[k])\n\nLucky for us, we have the get() dictionary method. get() returns the value of a given key and None if the key doesn’t exist.\n\nprint(dict_color_code.get('white'))\n\nNone\n\n\nThese are two solutions to the same problem. I prefer the get() method as it handles non-existent keys. The approach you choose is up to you."

    "section": "Amazing Arguments",
    "text": "Amazing Arguments\nA function is a great way of automating mundane tasks. They are a key part of writing concise, readable, and reproducible code.\nIn recent versions of Python, there have been updates made to how arguments are used. Firstly, there are two types of arguments:\n\nPositional: passed first in the function call and are identified using order.\nKeyword: passed after positional arguments and are identified by name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Rule\n\n\n\nPostional arguments must ALWAYS come before keyword arguments. Specifying a positional argument before keyword arguments results in an error.\n\n\nLet’s define a handy function below. I actually used this the other day!\n\ndef check_substring(\n    s:str               # a string\n    ,substrings:[]      # a list of substrings\n    ,all_strings: bool = False  # a boolean to choose between all and any\n    ):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a list of substrings is present in a string. \n    If all_strings, all substrings must be present in s to return True.\n    Else, there must be at least one occurance to return True.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if all_strings: return all([substring in s for substring in substrings])\n    else: return any([substring in s for substring in substrings])\n\nThis function has three parameters. All arguments can be specified as positional or keyword. all_strings is the only argument with a default value (False).\n\nsubstrings = ['man', 'ant', 'who']\ns = 'Maniac is a brilliant TV show.' # Some substrings present\n\n# This is how I call the function whe  all_strings is False\nprint(f'any substrings in s: {check_substring(s, substrings)}')\n\n# This is how I call the funciton when all_strings is True\nprint(f'all substrings in s: {check_substring(s, substrings, all_strings=True)}')\n\n# I usually use positional arguments for the first few, then keywords\n# Let's use all keywords to show that works too\nprint(f\"any substrings in s: {check_substring(s=s, substrings=substrings, all_strings=False)}\")\n\n# And all positional for completeness\nprint(f\"any substrings in s: {check_substring(s, substrings, False)}\")\n\nany substrings in s: True\nall substrings in s: False\nany substrings in s: True\nany substrings in s: True\n\n\nNow I’d like to make two changes.\n\nI want all_strings to be a keyword-only argument.\nI want to pass each substring as an argument rather than as part of a list.\n\n* solves both issues. See the example below.\n\ndef check_substring(\n    s:str               # a string\n    ,*substrings      # an interable tuple of substrings (note: *)\n    ,all_strings: bool = False  # a boolean to choose between all and any\n    ):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a tuple of substrings is present in a string. \n    If all, all substrings must be present in s to return True.\n    Else, there must be at least one occurance to return True.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if all_strings: return all([substring in s for substring in substrings])\n    else: return any([substring in s for substring in substrings])\n\nNow all_strings must be passed as a keyword (never positional). This is helpful because code readability is important. While this function only has three arguments, there are many functions with too many arguments to count. Thus, using positional arguments wouldn’t make sense and would be a pain to decipher in those cases.\n\ns = 'Maniac is a brilliant TV show.' # Some substrings present\n\n# Now we can add substrings manually to the function call.\nprint(f\"any substrings in s: {check_substring(s, 'man', 'ant', 'who')}\")\n\nany substrings in s: True\n\n\nEverything works dandy above, but what happens if we do pass all_substrings as a positional argument?\nLet’s fuck around and find out!\n# now let's change all to True\nprint(f\"all substrings in s: {check_substring(s, 'li', 'gr', 'te', True)}\")\nTypeError: 'in &lt;string&gt;' requires string as left operand, not bool\nPython interpreted False as being part of the *substrings argument. It expected a string but instead got a bool (and it was not happy). When we use *, all succeeding positional arguments are assumed to be part of the same set (in this case, substrings). That’s why all the remaining arguments must be passed using keywords.\nWe could remove the default value for all_strings, then it’d be a required (rather than optional) keyword-only argument.\n** collects all the optional keyword-only arguments into a dictionary. With **, there is no need to specify all keywords that have default values. The code will be more concise as a result.\n\ndef get_connection_string(self, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Get the connection string for a database\"\"\"\n    con_string = f\"{kwargs.get('user')}:{kwargs.get('password')}\\\n        @{kwargs.get('host')}/{kwargs.get('myschema')}\"\n\n    return con_string\n\nWe have now covered four types of arguments.\n\n\n\nLabel\nArgument Type\n\n\n\n\n1\nPositional arguments\n\n\n2\nTuple of positional arguments\n\n\n3\nKeyword-only arguments\n\n\n4\nDictionary of optional keyword arguments\n\n\n\n# parg: Positional argument\n# kwarg: Keyword arguments\n\ndef function_with_all_argument_types(\n    #&lt;----  1  ----&gt;\n    arg1, arg2, ..., \n\n    #&lt;- 2 -&gt;\n    *args, \n\n    #&lt;------ 3 -------&gt;\n    kwarg1, kwarg2, ..., \n\n    #&lt;-- 4 --&gt;\n    **kwargs\n    )\n    return"

    "text": "I was three days out. Thirteen weeks of training. Three unanimous wins, one by TKO. I wanted to believe I was ready.\nBut the signs were there, post-fight insomnia lingered into Tuesday, April 8th. My nose was still blocked, unwelcome signs the flu was still present. I had 2kg to cut over the next 3 days which was manageable, nothing I was concerned about.\nThe remaining Dublin Novice Finals took place on Wednesday evening. A few of us from the club supported James and Nikolina, who won the men’s 80kg and women’s 64kg categories, respectively.\nIn bed that evening, pent-up emotion bubbled under the surface. I’d received many congratulations since the Novices final, but my body’s response was unsettling. It felt like I’d reached the end but the real test was only beginning. My mind wanted a break I couldn’t afford.\nMidday Thursday, I started fasting and packing my bags for the evening flight. I was heading over with Melvin, he was fighting in the 63.5kg weight class. The flight was late and we didn’t get settled until after midnight. I was 1kg over before bed.\nI woke up at 6:30 with 0.4kg left to go. With the help of light skipping in the sweat suit, I weighed in at 67 on the dot. Things were going smoothly. I was in control.\nMy fight was scheduled for the evening session around seven. This gave me time to refuel – a massive help. I loosened out with light shadow boxing at half one. I felt fluid and relaxed.\nI followed with a visualisation, but something was was off. Normally, I’d feel the shift — heart rate rising, body lighting up, that sense of it’s fight night. But I felt flat. It was abrupt — like my body had just said no.\nPerhaps I just needed time. I continued my routine with a short nap. But when I woke, it felt like I’d come out of a deep, heavy sleep — my muscles slack. After showering, I ate my final snack, but my stomach was uneasy. Things didn’t feel right, and a quiet fear crept in.\nBut this is what I’d prepared for. Things don’t go to plan. I had to focus on the controllables. Melvin was boxing in the afternoon session, and I was doing his corner. Three of the five bouts before his ended early, which pushed his forward and I had to rush over sooner than expected. He gave a great performance and won by unanimous decision. The rush had sparked something inside me.\nThe afternoon session ended earlier than expected. At 5pm, I was told my fight had been pushed forward half an hour giving me 90 minutes to get back to the apartment, grab my gear, return to the venue, and warm up. It was enough time but only if everything went smoothly.\nI arrived at the apartment after getting a taxi. But as I reached for my keys, my pockets were empty. My face flushed and my stomach dropped. I called back the taxi. I retraced my steps to the venue with no luck. Then a silly thought hit: did I even check my bag? I opened it up and found them inside. Confusion, relief, and embarrassment evoked a flurry of questions.\nWhy had I put them there? How hadn’t I remembered? How had I let a simple moment spiral?\nBut there was no time for questions. By the time I returned to the venue, it was past six. I arrived flustered, angry, and frustrated. I practiced controlling my breath but it was futile. I was struggling to calm myself.\nIn my warm-up, doubt was creeping in. I returned to my mantras. I reminded myself who I was, what I’d done, and what I was capable of. But it wasn’t encouragement. It was like whipping myself into action. I performed combinations with force, not flow. I wasn’t calm. I was desperate. This is what I’d been working toward — and if my body wasn’t responding, I’d have to drag it out of myself.\nAs I walked out ringside, there was one more round in the bout before mine. I was waiting in the wings, tense and anxious. I stayed on my toes to loosen out.\nTo my left, I noticed the guy in red kit — my opponent. He stood casually like a spectator. One foot on the platform, weight leaning on his knee. His posture was soft. He seemed present, free of thought. I found myself comparing his body language to mine. I was forcing myself to relax. He simply was.\nIt was time to step up to the ring. I performed my ritual and went through the usual checks. When I tapped the corner, I repeated my mantra like I was clinging to a script.\nplayful snappy relentless…\nIn the opening moments of round 1, I moved to the centre and he took the back foot with a grounded, composed Philly shell. He eased into the corner. Rather than cutting off the ring, I sensed I was walking into a trap. He was waiting for my move.\nI threw feints before launching a flurry of wild punches. I overextended and fell in. He dodged everything — leaning back, crouching, and smothering. He exploded on the inside with several fast, powerful punches, starting to the body and then going to the head.\nThat was the pattern throughout the round. He watched and waited, maintaining a tight defence, then countered sharply once I committed. He went to the body to drop my guard then swung heavy shots to the head.\nWhen I sidestepped his attack, I saw he was off balance. There was an opportunity to exploit those openings but my reactions were slow which gave him time to reset.\nMidway through the round, I tried to keep him away with an active jab — either catching him on the way in or tying him up once he got close. But I had no bounce in my feet like I was stuck to the ground.\nDespite being smaller, he was physically stronger on the inside and pushed me around with ease. At one point, I fell to the canvas as I lost balance, my body was full of tension.\nIn the final 30 seconds, there was a short break to fix his jersey. I remember blowing out my nose as it was still blocked up.\nI committed to the back foot in round 2, using it to draw him in — then pivot and counter. For the first 90 seconds, I caught him clean many times. I was moving on pure instinct, and to my surprise, I was having success. I’d rarely fought this way before, but it looked like I could take the round.\nAt the two-minute mark, I saw him momentarily off balance and I jumped in too eagerly — walking straight into a clean, powerful right hook to the chin. It shook me. I tried to smother the exchange to buy time and regain composure. But I was rocked.\nIn the last 30 seconds, he lunged forward landing a double backhand-hook. The referee gave me my first count.\nI raised my hands to show I was ready and continued. He had likely won the second round. Therefore, he fought smart. He stepped off, didn’t overcommit, and let me come to him. It was on me to chase the fight now. I’d have to win by stoppage.\nIn the corner, I wasn’t present. My mind had pulled away from the fight. The only instruction I held onto was: let him come forward and throw the backhand-hook.\nIn round 3, I tried to bait him in again. I feinted, trying to draw a reaction — but he didn’t bite. My movement was slow and heavy. I was running out of options.\nI couldn’t fight him on the front foot — his defence was tight and his counters were dangerous. Inside, he was stronger and smarter, attacking the body and head in combination. On the back foot, he closed distance quickly and my reactions weren’t sharp enough.\nI’d exhausted every approach and a terrible feeling came over me — powerlessness. I was in fight-or-flight. I had an urge to get out of there. I was doing everything I could to avoid getting hit while still trying to land anything.\nOne minute into the round, he landed a single clean shot. It didn’t seem big, but the ref gave me a second count. I returned to the fight, still trying to make something happen.\nThirty seconds later, he caught me again. The ref stepped in for a third count. After counting to eight, she looked at me and struck the air to call the fight. I stood there in disbelief.\nI walked to the corner, took off my headgear and gloves, and returned to centre ring. His hand was raised. Just like that, my shot at the Porto Box Cup was over.\nWhen I exited the ring, the moment came as a shock. I felt numb like the air had been sucked out of the room. I went out and cooled down, not really knowing what to say or do. There was an internal dam holding all feeling back. But that wouldn’t last for long.\nNext week, I’ll walk through the sobering come down after the loss and share the experience of facing failure."

    "text": "After losing my quarter-final fight, I learned that grieving extends beyond losing a loved one and includes losing something meaningful like a goal as well.\nThe evening, I walked home with my clubmate Melvin and my coach. It was dark outside, and I remember my attention being absorbed by the glare of the street lamps. While the others chatted, I was quiet and subdued, only murmuring one-worded replies or nods of agreement.\nI showered while listening to some music. When I got out, I looked at myself in the mirror. I iced the swelling above my right eye and cleared the remainder of mucus from my throat and sinuses. For a while, I stayed in my room, sitting in silence. Thoughts hummed like static in the background. I flicked through the events like a disorganised Rolodex, trying to grasp what had happened.\nAs the initial shock morphed, my mind moved from analysing the fight toward shame. It began with a string of thoughts I failed. I am a failure. I am weak.\nIt wasn’t about my preparation or my opponent. It was about my identity. The loss wasn’t just a setback; it was a reflection of who I was.\nEventually, I went downstairs, grabbed some food, and talked with my coach. He was sympathetic and acknowledged how much the goal had meant to me. The fight had surprised him. In the first round, he thought I would steamroll my opponent. He didn’t think my opponent was any big shake and said he should’ve been warned for slapping a few times. But he could see I wasn’t myself. I wasn’t present in the corner or taking in what he was saying. He thought that if I’d boxed like I did in the Dublin Novices, I could have beaten him.\nAfter that conversation, I began shifting from shame to sadness, no longer believing it was entirely my fault. I created distance between myself and the result: I couldn’t have won. I was still sick. Circumstances determined the outcome, not me.\nThe following morning, I woke with a dulled sadness. A cloud hung over me for most of the day, broken by conversation or distraction. I rang a few people at home to talk through what happened. They agreed my performance had seemed off and tried to piece together what might’ve gone wrong in the build-up.\nMelvin had his semi-final fight that evening and I wanted to support him in his corner with the remaining energy I had. Despite Melvin warming up, he won by walkover due to complications with his opponent’s team being disqualified. That evening, I asked Melvin to get some fresh air with me. We walked and talked, which lifted my spirits. He brought a calming presence and I appreciated him being there.\nBy Sunday, the sadness had shifted to anger and resentment. In the pit of my stomach sat both. I wanted someone or something to blame. If I’d changed this, done that, or listened to one person over another, maybe the result would’ve been different. It felt unfair. After all the work, I didn’t get the result. In my mind, I blamed people who had simply believed in me more than I’d believed in myself.\nMelvin had his final that day and he won by stoppage in the 3rd round. It was a great performance and it brought a positive note to the trip.\nI stayed in Porto until Tuesday, relaxing and roaming the city with Melvin.\nBefore leaving Porto, one of the coaches messaged me saying I’d actually boxed well. I’d picked clean shots and held my own, even if I’d been caught a few times.\nHis message surprised me. It added a different perspective, softened how I saw the fight and helped bring nuance to the loss.\nBy the time I returned home, a calmness began to settle. Compared to Porto, everyday life felt lighter. I felt more resilient, like I could handle things better.\nThose perspectives eventually balanced out. What remained was simple: I had did the work, but by the final stretch I was drained. The flu, fatigue, and divided focus all played their part. Despite that, I done my best and adapted where I could. My opponent simply boxed better than I did.\nOne moment still stands out. When I couldn’t find my keys before the fight, I lost composure. That moment showed me how quickly panic can snowball. Next time, I’ll pause and breathe.\nNo one’s at fault. What matters is what I learn. The lesson once again is composure under pressure. I pushed past my limit and lost composure. However, I also pushed my capabilities. That’s the takeaway and unfortunate truth. Composure isn’t something I can solve; it’s something I keep developing — learning from past challenges and taking on bigger ones."

    "text": "Training was back on track. But weight wasn’t shifting.\nEarlier in camp, I’d attended a talk called “Fuelling Success” by Boxing Olympians Grainne Walsh, Jenny Lehane, and Daina Morehouse, and Sharon Madigan (Head of Nutrition for Irish Boxing). A few key takeaways stuck with me.\nNutrition, they said, should be treated as a core part of training, not something separate. You should establish consistent food routines so that nothing feels unfamiliar before a fight. And most importantly, under-fuelling carries risk. It can start as small strains and fatigue before developing into more severe issues, such as illness, torn muscles, and broken bones. On the other hand, fuelling properly allows you to train harder, more consistently, and recover better.\nFor someone fighting at 67kg, my training weight should sit around 70 to 71kg. Gradual weight loss was encouraged, as rapid weight loss was found to have a significant impact on performance.\nAt the time, I was sitting around 72.5–73kg — already 1.5–2kg over the training weight. And my energy for training was hit-or-miss.\nMy routine for food consisted of three main meals, at 9 am, 1 pm, and 9 pm. I applied the advice by adding a snack around 4 pm to fuel my evening training. That fourth meal used quick-releasing carbohydrates, with low fibre and low fat. Eating around two hours before training worked best for me.\nRice pudding became a go-to, as well as bananas and white bread with honey. Options like cereal left me hungry, and jam was too sharp, so I settled on what felt simple and digestible.\nI maintained a steady protein intake throughout the day (130 to 150 grams daily) and adjusted my carb intake based on training load, reducing them on non-training days. But realistically, at the beginning of camp, I was training nearly every day. That left very little room to reduce without impacting performance.\nAnd across the first seven weeks, I hadn’t lost much weight. My weight management was inconsistent, with constant fluctuation due to stress, injury, and time off. There was no clear downward trend, and that concerned me. The graph below illustrates the inconsistency. I had a lot to lose, and the time window was shrinking fast.\n\n\n\nFight Camp Weight Challenges\n\n\nAfter returning to training following my concussion, I made some adjustments. I dropped to five days a week – three club sessions and two hybrid sessions, combining gym and boxing, with a focus on explosive drills.\nThe session began with a power circuit: dumbbell jumps, rotational med ball throws, med ball slams, and jumping lunges, 3-5 reps at 100% effort. Then I moved to the landmine press and weighted shadowing (30s weighted, 30s unweighted). I finished the session with sprints on the assault bike (10s on, 50s rest). The entire session was about sharpness and precision. And I really enjoyed it.\nAfter my first spar back on Wednesday, 26th February, I spoke with my coach. He brought up the Dublin Novices, suggesting it would be a good opportunity for fight experience before Porto. I had overlooked it as my focus was on Porto, but it made sense as a tune-up rather than going into Porto raw without recent fight experience.\nFighting at 67kg meant making weight in just 25 days instead of 44 for Porto. A sharp cut was now unavoidable. I felt the pressure immediately.\nThursday 27th February marked the start of Week 8, a rest week I’d planned back in January, including a weekend trip away with friends. At the time, missing three days of training didn’t seem like a big deal. But now, with just over three weeks until weigh-in and 5.5kg to lose, it felt like bad timing and a risky decision.\nI went anyway. And if I’m honest, I ate all around me.\nThursday evening, I had a work party. I told myself I’d be measured, but I still ate more than I was comfortable with. Then on Friday, I trained before leaving on the trip.\nOver the weekend, I made half-hearted attempts to be mindful, but for the most part, I wasn’t. I ate without restraint or strategy. Sleep wasn’t great either. I’d planned to be in bed by 10 or 11, but we didn’t sleep until 12 or 1 each night. So I wasn’t training, sleeping, or eating well. For a “rest week,” it didn’t seem restful at all.\nI enjoyed the time with friends. But I also felt guilty and frustrated with myself. I knew it would spike my weight. And it did. But afterwards, I accepted it. I moved on and got back to work.\nThe following Wednesday, I was sparring with one of the lads as part of his prep for the National Intervarsities that weekend. The spar was okay, but my work rate needed to be higher.\nThe National Intervarsities took place on Saturday and I went down to support. The club later went on to win 7 gold and 1 silver in the finals across novice, intermediate, and senior categories – a massive result. But on that day, in the interim between fights, I went for a walk down by the Grand Canal. I was looking ahead at the next 2 weeks, and I was still at 72.3kg, 5.3 over.\nIn that moment, I made a decision. Over the next two weeks, I was going to cut hard and reach 67kg. I accepted the challenge, and I believed I was capable of losing the weight, performing in the ring, and maintaining focus all the way through to Porto.\nI had begun water loading that day, drinking around 3-4L of water to kickstart the cut. However, on the bus on the way home, I encountered a problem. As I sat down to perform a mental visualisation, I had a terrible urge to use the toilet, but I tried to hold it in. I focused on breathing to help relax…without relaxing too much. Then something strange happened. After battling the urge to simply get off the bus and ‘go,’ I felt an intense calmness wash over me through the breathing practice. The urge dissipated, and in my visualisation, I felt really loose and relaxed. My shoulders dropped. My arms felt light and supple, like a whip.\nPreviously, mentally rehearsing combinations had felt impossible. The image of myself was never grounded; it felt like I was throwing punches while floating in space.\nBut now, I could see myself grounded in the ring. I was pressuring my opponent and cutting off space, like smoke filling a room. I combined feints, combinations, and defence fluidly. Another moment of clarity. In the process of trying not to piss myself, I ended up focusing on breathing so intently that I grounded myself, giving myself this feeling of mental ‘gravity’ that I had been missing before.\nThe following day, I had a sharp hybrid session, and I felt like the explosive training was paying off.\nOn Monday, I had a session like no other. Entering training, I held an aggressive focus, with all distractions zoned out. During shadow boxing, I felt sharp and light on my feet. My body was relaxed but explosive. During sparring, I maintained a high work rate, blending offense and defense. I felt this deep, unwavering self-belief, free from self-doubt. One of the lads commented that I looked like a man possessed.\nI believed that if I brought this version of myself into the fight, I’d win.\nIn the Wednesday session, I focused more on defence, footwork, and countering in my sparring. I used feints to draw my partner in and waited for them to strike before defending and countering.\nBy Sunday, I was one week out from the weigh-in, and I was now at 71kg, with 4kg left to go.\nNext week, I will describe in detail my final week of cutting weight. You won’t want to miss it."

    "text": "With the Dublin Novices Championship weigh-in complete, it was time to switch focus to fight prep.\nOn Monday 24th March at 11am, I found out I was fighting Tuesday night. The news hit with a mix of nerves and eagerness — just over 30 hours to shift into fight mode.\nI already knew my opponent. I’d watched him in the Intervarsity Finals at 67kg. A Southpaw — fast, aggressive, and confident, maybe even cocky. I believed I had more power and planned to break him down under pressure.\nThat day, I visualised what I wanted to do — move my head, cut off the ring, close the distance. I pictured arriving at the venue, walking to the blue corner, stepping up to the ring — left, right, left, right, left — and performing my ring ritual.\nI trained that evening, drilling southpaw-specific distance work, lead hand control, and tailored combinations. Sparring experience earlier in camp had made the stance feel familiar.\nAt home, I topped up carbs and ran through a negative visualisation: making mistakes, adapting in real time, and staying composed under pressure.\nI got to bed around midnight and woke up Tuesday feeling under slept midnight. My body felt achy with a little mental tiredness lingering. Breakfast included porridge, yogurt, banana, and berries to load up on carbs.\nDuring work, I felt strangely cold despite everyone being in t-shirts. But I put on a jacket and thought no more of it. I took a half day at lunch, ate some pasta and chicken before walking home in the sunshine listening to Roy Ayers Ubiquity, Frank Ocean, and Jungle.\nAt home, I ran a full mental visualisation — arriving, warming up, walking out, and going through my ring ritual. I remembered a clip of Ethan Hawke’s advice on performance: “Preparation, preparation, preparation… let go.” And I did. All the work was done and I felt the weight drop from my shoulders.\nI took a 20-minute nap, then showered to freshen up, packing my bag while listening to summer music: Empire of the Sun, Macklemore, Mac Miller. I ate rice pudding and a banana around 5 while watching Mad Men and called my parents for a chat.\nAt 7, I met my clubmates and headed to the venue. I watched one or two fights, then performed my final visualisation – the whole fight, start to finish, transitioning into the zone. With my headphones on, I disappeared into my own world, listening to Irish rock classics: Thin Lizzy, U2, The Cranberries.\nI took a small 1x2 metre space in the corner of the packed dressing room, warming up while facing a mirror. With two fights to go, my coach brought me out for pads. Nothing existed except the task in front of me: get in the ring, fight, and win.\nAs I walked out to the blue corner, it all felt familiar — the crowd, the noise, and the nerves. I stepped up into the ring — left, right, left, right, left — and moved through the ropes, gliding across the ring and back. We approached the centre. I looked my opponent in the eye. He looked confident, but I was unfazed, I was ready. We tapped gloves and eased back to our corners.\nMoments before the bell, I tapped the corner three times.\nPlayful. Snappy. Relentless.\nI started round one static and reserved, getting the measure of my opponent. He managed distance by catching me with straight jabs.\nNinety seconds in, my nose began bleeding, the fight paused, and the doctor cleaned it up. I reminded myself, it’s only the first round, just move my head and loosen up.\nIn the next exchange, he threw a one-two. I slipped right, landed a lead hook to the body, followed by a straight cross. I remembered the look in his eye, he had felt it.\nIn the corner, my coach reminded me to move my head and work specific combinations.\nIn round two, I applied pressure, but still got caught. Midway through the round, he slowed. I cornered him and landed the same combination — slip right, lead hook to the body, straight down the middle — followed by a second cross that threw his head back. The ref stepped in and called for a 10 count, my opponent leaning across the ropes. The bell rang soon after.\nBack in the corner, I felt in more control, but the fight was still up for grabs. I knew I had to push it home in the third.\nIn the final round, I landed a few hard shots, the ref paused the fight, now my opponent was bleeding and had to get checked. Throughout the round, we exchanged repeatedly, but I landed the cleaner, more visible shots.\nAt the final bell, I returned to my corner confident. I shook the hands of my opponent and his coach, and stood beside the referee. My arm was raised. I’d won by unanimous decision. I felt a thrill as I met my brothers and clubmates who came to support me.\nBack home, the buzz of the adrenaline lingered, it felt like drinking 5 expresso shots. As my mind buzzed, I didn’t sleep until 2am. Another poor night of sleep.\nI woke up the next morning and shook off the tiredness. But at training, my concentration was lower. As I worked on the pads with my coach, I messed up the combinations and became frustrated. Thankfully, coach encouraged me to keep at it which grounded me. Eventually I got into a groove, and ended the session strongly.\nBefore bed, my mind was exhausted but still had to plan out my meals for Thursday with my semi-final on Friday. My thoughts were disorganised and it took forever to cook and prep meals, and clean up after. Weight management was still on my mind as I was back up to 71. But I reassured myself it was natural. Focus on winning my fights now, worry about weight later. Once again, I didn’t get to sleep until around midnight.\nI rested on Thursday giving me time to reflect. I knew I needed to improve a few things: allow more time for warm-up, start sharp, and maintain head movement. I’d gotten a lot of praise from Tuesday’s win, but I didn’t want to feel like I’d accomplished anything yet. The Dublin Novices was good experience, but my main goal was to win the Porto Box Cup.\nMy coach said it was possible I’d fight Friday and again on Saturday, so I needed food ready right after the fight to refuel for the next day.\nI had planned another carb load. I aimed for over 3,000 calories and over 500 grams of carbohydrates, split across breakfast, lunch, an afternoon snack, and dinner.\nOn Friday morning, my energy was low. The sleep debt was building, but I pushed it aside again. By lunchtime, I slipped into the same rhythm as Tuesday — slow walk home with chill music in my ears, followed by a ringwalk visualisation. Then a nap, a shower, a call home, and television while eating my last snack.\nOn the way to the venue, I felt nervous. I didn’t know my opponent, unlike last time, and I could feel the butterflies flutter inside. After arriving, I did my final rehearsal. I went inside to warm up, listening to Irish rock. I took up the same 1x2 metre space, familiar now. I’d given myself more time for a warm-up, and by the end of it, I felt better than I had the previous fight.\nI fell into flow when on the pads with my coach. Outside noise faded like we were alone in a quiet room. My eyes were locked in tunnel vision and I was switched on.\nOn the way out, I saw the back of my dad’s jacket and gave him a nudge as I walked past. Getting into the ring, the transition felt seamless like I’d been there all along. The ref went through the rules as I looked my opponent in the eye. As I returned to my corner, I tapped it three times.\nPlayful. Snappy. Relentless.\nIn the first round, we started light on our feet, measuring with our jabs. In the opening exchanges, I landed some strong shots and had success pushing him back. However, he countered and evaded many attacks with fluid movement. Halfway through, I blocked a shot and retaliated with a rear hook to the body catching him clean. As the round finished, I slowed and his control in exchanges – getting in, landing, and moving out and around – put him ahead.\nAt the end of the round, my coach said, “Diarmuid, if you try and out-box this fella, you’re going to lose. You need to break him down by keeping the intensity high. Don’t let him settle into a rhythm.”\nRound two started with the same cat and mouse: me trying to corner him, him trying to counter and evade. But this time I was more measured and didn’t jump in too soon. In our first proper exchange, we went toe to toe, and I caught him a few times before he moved off. Then, in another exchange, I landed backhands and had success on the inside.\nHalfway through the round, I had him in a corner. He was struggling to get out as I landed shots. Eventually, he escaped, but I stayed on him with jabs, never letting him out of sight. Pressing him against the ropes, I threw one-twos, then a hook-cross that raised his guard — exposing his body — and finished with a powerful lead hook downstairs.\nThe ref stepped in and called a 10-count and what happened next surprised me. He went back to his corner, dropped to his hunkers, and shook his head. He was struggling. The ref counted, but he didn’t stand up. Eventually, the ref waved the fight off and I’d won.\nIt was my first ever stoppage. I was shocked and proud. I’d outworked him. Back in my corner, I high-fived my coach. He looked at me and said, “Do I tell lies, do I?” I laughed. He told me to press him and disrupt his rhythm, and it worked.\nAfterwards, my clubmates and my dad were there to congratulate me. It felt electric. We stayed to watch my teammate David fight next. He lost but held his own against an opponent well above the novice category, claiming to be Conor McGregor’s sparring partner!\nLater that evening, I found out that the final wouldn’t be the next day. It was pushed out to Monday, the 7th of April, four days before my quarter-final fight in Porto. It wasn’t ideal, but I had to get on with it.\nGetting sleep proved to be a much greater challenge. My brain went into overdrive trying to figure out how to handle the next two weeks; managing my weight, refueling, and training. My thoughts were jumping around. After my quarter-final win, I’d felt like I’d had five coffees. Now it felt like fifty.\nI used everything I could: meditation, a walk, even splashing water on my face, some light exercise but my mind wouldn’t settle. I eventually got to sleep at 3 a.m., ending a hectic week with poor recovery.\nI had one week to go until my final. One more after that until Porto was over. I’d already asked a lot of my body. Now I just needed to give a little more.\nNext week, find out how my body responded during the week break before the final and how the Dublin Novices wrapped up."

    "text": "When I was younger, a recurring phrase I often heard was, “Your college years are some of the best years of your life.” Me being me, I took this assertion quite seriously. If college was significantly valuable, I was determined to seize every opportunity it presented. I adopted an iterative approach, leveraging my experiences from past semesters alongside advice I received from others to inform my approach to each subsequent term.\nUpon reflection, I find this approach similar to a subsection of Artificial Intelligence called Reinforcement Learning, a concept ironically inspired by human learning. In this analogy, I acted as the Agent, navigating college life, which served as the Environment with each semester being each time step T. The beginning of each semester marked the State. My actions within each semester comprised the Action. The strategy I adopted each term became the Policy. How I felt at the term’s conclusion represented the Reward. Meanwhile, my expected emotional state, given a particular strategy within a semester, resembled the Value Function. My introspective process at the end of each semester mirrored the workings of a Learning Algorithm (my brain, I suppose).\nSimilar to any reinforcement learning algorithm, I had to find a balance between exploration (trying new things) and exploitation (sticking with what I knew). Throughout the first three years, I struggled to find what was right for me. But, with some persistent experimentation and self-reflection, I managed to find my place. I learned one key lesson from each semester, culminating in eight lessons that I intend to share across eight blog posts over the next eight weeks (credit to Deborah for that idea).\nEach year of my college experience revolved around a specific theme: Year 1 focused on Relationships, Year 2 delved into Lifestyle, Year 3 centred on Career, and Year 4 encapsulated Growth, bringing together aspects from the previous three years.\nMy aspiration with these posts is that they are valuable. I hope that reading about the lessons I’ve learned from my life can help you in navigating yours. To support your self-reflection, I’ll share three introspective questions each week that I asked myself at the time of learning each lesson. By answering these questions honestly, you may uncover blind spots that have been holding you back in surprising ways."

    "text": "💡  What do you define as a shallow and a deep relationship?         How do you prioritise and maintain close relationships?         What is your experience with shallow and deep relationships? \n\nMy first year of college marked a stark contrast from my secondary school Leaving Certificate year. In secondary school, I often spent considerable time alone. Yet, in college, it was a whirlwind of meeting people—everywhere I turned, someone new awaited.\nWhether in campus accommodation, clubs, societies, house parties, or during nights out, the initial semester revolved around encountering fresh faces nearly every day. Living in campus accommodation made chance encounters common, sparking conversations about our settling-in experiences, activities, or which nights we planned to venture into Dublin City Centre.\nInitially, meeting many new students and engaging in constant conversations was invigorating. However, as time passed, I noticed these exchanges seldom penetrated the surface. Despite my attempts to delve into topics that interested me, the shared enthusiasm often seemed lacking.\nConversations about my activities or learning pursuits were often met with a neutral response, akin to ‘sounds interesting, but not my thing.’ I had joined various clubs and societies, hoping for more meaningful interactions, yet found myself caught in repetitive conversations that didn’t quite match my interests. I desired deeper discussions but struggled to find like-minded people.\nDespite the many friendly encounters, I felt a persistent sense of solitude. I had yet to connect deeply with anyone new. Disappointed, I wondered if I was overlooking something. While it seemed like everyone had established their friend circles, I felt stuck in the middle.\nLooking back now, surrounded by friends I value, I’ve realised that prioritising spending quality time with people, immersing myself in supportive environments, practising patience, and allowing relationships to naturally develop were pivotal for me.\nBuilding and prioritising close relationships is important. Over time, surface-level connections can feel unfulfilling. Find people with whom you feel comfortable and can have fun, who celebrate your successes, and support you through failure. If you find yourself lacking close relationships, consider if you’re spending sufficient quality time around people, if your environment is supportive, or if you just need to be patient.\nIn conclusion, by the semester’s end, I wasn’t completely lost, I had found some friends with whom I enjoyed spending time. I hoped these relationships would deepen into something more meaningful. However, the second semester had other plans in mind for me, teaching me one of my most difficult lessons yet, which I’ll delve into in next week’s post."

    "text": "💡  What do you believe confidence is?         What people, activities or situations impact your confidence either positively or negatively?         Do you believe you could improve your confidence?\n\nIn my final semester, I had no big plans. I aimed to stick with the clubs and societies I enjoyed, finish my coursework, and leave college content. At the start of the semester, there was talk about a boxing intervarsity competition, which seemed both thrilling and daunting. I lacked experience, and the idea of participating felt like a losing battle, I thought I’d get killed! Yet, as the weeks passed, I diligently worked on the basics as I learned in Semester 4, growing more comfortable in my form and sparring skills. On February 10th, I committed to entering the competition, with just five weeks to prepare. I weighed around 74kg, fighting in the 69kg weight class. Cutting 5kg in 5 weeks felt like a formidable task as I had no prior experience. I gathered insights from podcasts produced by the nutritionist I worked with in Semester 4. They addressed using a calorie tracker, implementing a mini-cut, and understanding the satiety index. I synthesised this information into a 5-week plan. To ensure my approach was sound, I reached out to my nutritionist, who approved my strategy but suggested fight week protocols to drop an extra 1-2kg if needed.\nMy plan revolved around three key principles:\n\nMaintain a calorie deficit to lose weight.\nConsume high-satiety foods to curb hunger.\nEnsure sufficient protein intake to preserve muscle.\n\nI made these specific changes:\n\nCalorie cut from 2750 to 1750 daily. I calculated this using the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Weight Planner.\nDaily protein intake at 1.5-2g per kilogram body weight. Focused on chicken, turkey, egg whites and powdered whey.\nIncreased intake of filling fruits and non-starchy vegetables.\nOpted for high-satiety carbohydrates like potatoes and oats.\nMade low-calorie swaps like low-fat milk, 1-calorie spray and low-cal sauces.\nDrank water and coffee in the morning to offset hunger\nTracked calories by weighing all food items.\nAvoided highly palatable food like chocolates and sweets.\n\nMy weekly training involved:\n\n3 boxing sessions\n2-3 gym and sprint sessions\nyoga and gymnastics for fun and relaxation\n\nInitially, everything went well, I made progress in training and the diet didn’t seem to both me too much. However, after three weeks, my energy plummeted, leading to constant fatigue and hunger. This affected my thoughts and emotions, creating a cycle of food preoccupation. Despite this, I felt unexpectedly resilient. I believed I could tackle any challenge I set my mind to, fostering a sense of confidence I hadn’t anticipated.\nOn the day of my first fight, I found myself still above the required weight (69kg). After spending an hour in the sauna (15 minutes at a time), I finally made weight, bringing a sigh of relief. Following that, I rehydrated and prepared myself both mentally and physically by focusing on my fight plan and doing warm-up exercises. When it was my turn, I entered the ring feeling focused rather than nervous. I was reserved and tense initially, but as the fight progressed, I became more aggressive, landing more powerful shots and gaining control. It was clear I was the stronger opponent and I won by unanimous decision.\nI had reached the All-Ireland Intervarsity final against an opponent, boasting greater experience, speed, and agility. This showdown was scheduled two weeks ahead. During this period, I closely studied his bouts, strategising with my coach to counter his style. Doubtful thoughts lingered in my mind about his superiority over me. However, learning from Semester 5, I let go of any expectations I had of winning, allowing me to dedicate my focus to training and mental preparation.\nWhen the fight day arrived, I was ready. I had managed to cut my weight to 69kg during the week, making the weigh-in effortless. I warmed up and performed pad work with my coach. My name was called out and I made my way up to the ring. Stepping into the ring, my face was greased with Vaseline, gloves were snug on my wrists, and the head guard was fixed to my head. I geared up for the face-off, the referee outlined the rules, we tapped gloves and we returned to our respective corners.\nDing-ding! Round 1 — I moved out aggressively. I cornered my opponent, poised to land heavy blows, but he evaded swiftly to the side. Undeterred, I pushed him into the next corner and he dodged again. And a third time, BOOM! He countered with a lead hook, caught me off guard and knocked me off balance. I fell against the ropes and I got a standing count. This cat and mouse continued, with him dodging and countering many of my shots. I felt I was off to a bad start. Returning to my corner, I was advised to relax the power and throw shots more frequently.\nDing-ding! Round 2 — The next round saw me quickly moving out, with a more relaxed form, I let my jab go more often. I became better at closing the gap and wearing him down. As I noticed his guard drop, I landed my shots. The momentum began to shift. After the second round, I returned to my corner, seeking more advice. Sensing his fatigue, I stood up early, eager to show my tenacity.\nDing-ding! Round 3 — Once more, I charged forward, controlling the space, making it clear I was driven to win. I watched his evasions become slower and more predictable. Despite feeling exhausted, I disguised it by keeping on the front foot. At a pivotal moment, I managed to pin him against the ropes, launching a combination of shots. Sensing his mental fatigue, I battled to wear him down entirely, I pursued him relentlessly until the final bell.\nThe final bell rang and I returned to my coaches who were cheering. I asked them “Is that it? Is it over?”, my coach laughed, “Ye, it’s over…are you alright???”, “Ye I’m fine, I just want to know I can relax.” After removing my head guard, gloves, and gum shield, I approached the centre stage. As the referee grasped both our hands, the judges began to speak. I mentally prepared for defeat by telling myself I had lost and that it was all okay. But my hand was raised and I surged with joy as I claimed sweet victory. It was an electrifying moment, the culmination of tireless effort finally swinging in my favour.\nExiting the ring, I proudly accepted my All-Ireland medal and hugged my coach, who shared my triumph. I returned to my family who shared my glee. On the way back in the car, I spoke to my brother saying “You know it’s strange, doing this has been the most exhausting thing I’ve ever done but I’ve never felt calmer inside.” He told me he had noticed it too.\nMonths of intense training aimed at a singular goal had unexpectedly built a newfound confidence that manifested as a feeling of calmness. It was like stepping into a quiet room for the first time, where once, there had always been a buzzing noise. I realised that confidence was less about grandeur or and more about easing anxiety and finding comfort within oneself. If you want to build confidence, I believe in aiming for something challenging and meaningful. Then, pursue it with all you have."

Focused on chicken, turkey, egg whites and powdered whey.\nIncreased intake of filling fruits and non-starchy vegetables.\nOpted for high-satiety carbohydrates like potatoes and oats.\nMade low-calorie swaps like low-fat milk, 1-calorie spray and low-cal sauces.\nDrank water and coffee in the morning to offset hunger\nTracked calories by weighing all food items.\nAvoided highly palatable food like chocolates and sweets.\n\nMy weekly training involved:\n\n3 boxing sessions\n2-3 gym and sprint sessions\nyoga and gymnastics for fun and relaxation\n\nInitially, everything went well, I made progress in training and the diet didn’t seem to both me too much. However, after three weeks, my energy plummeted, leading to constant fatigue and hunger. This affected my thoughts and emotions, creating a cycle of food preoccupation. Despite this, I felt unexpectedly resilient. I believed I could tackle any challenge I set my mind to, fostering a sense of confidence I hadn’t anticipated.\nOn the day of my first fight, I found myself still above the required weight (69kg). After spending an hour in the sauna (15 minutes at a time), I finally made weight, bringing a sigh of relief. Following that, I rehydrated and prepared myself both mentally and physically by focusing on my fight plan and doing warm-up exercises. When it was my turn, I entered the ring feeling focused rather than nervous. I was reserved and tense initially, but as the fight progressed, I became more aggressive, landing more powerful shots and gaining control. It was clear I was the stronger opponent and I won by unanimous decision.\nI had reached the All-Ireland Intervarsity final against an opponent, boasting greater experience, speed, and agility. This showdown was scheduled two weeks ahead. During this period, I closely studied his bouts, strategising with my coach to counter his style. Doubtful thoughts lingered in my mind about his superiority over me. However, learning from Semester 5, I let go of any expectations I had of winning, allowing me to dedicate my focus to training and mental preparation.\nWhen the fight day arrived, I was ready. I had managed to cut my weight to 69kg during the week, making the weigh-in effortless. I warmed up and performed pad work with my coach. My name was called out and I made my way up to the ring. Stepping into the ring, my face was greased with Vaseline, gloves were snug on my wrists, and the head guard was fixed to my head. I geared up for the face-off, the referee outlined the rules, we tapped gloves and we returned to our respective corners.\nDing-ding! Round 1 — I moved out aggressively. I cornered my opponent, poised to land heavy blows, but he evaded swiftly to the side. Undeterred, I pushed him into the next corner and he dodged again. And a third time, BOOM! He countered with a lead hook, caught me off guard and knocked me off balance. I fell against the ropes and I got a standing count. This cat and mouse continued, with him dodging and countering many of my shots. I felt I was off to a bad start. Returning to my corner, I was advised to relax the power and throw shots more frequently.\nDing-ding! Round 2 — The next round saw me quickly moving out, with a more relaxed form, I let my jab go more often. I became better at closing the gap and wearing him down. As I noticed his guard drop, I landed my shots. The momentum began to shift. After the second round, I returned to my corner, seeking more advice. Sensing his fatigue, I stood up early, eager to show my tenacity.\nDing-ding! Round 3 — Once more, I charged forward, controlling the space, making it clear I was driven to win. I watched his evasions become slower and more predictable. Despite feeling exhausted, I disguised it by keeping on the front foot. At a pivotal moment, I managed to pin him against the ropes, launching a combination of shots. Sensing his mental fatigue, I battled to wear him down entirely, I pursued him relentlessly until the final bell.\nThe final bell rang and I returned to my coaches who were cheering. I asked them “Is that it? Is it over?”, my coach laughed, “Ye, it’s over…are you alright???”, “Ye I’m fine, I just want to know I can relax.” After removing my head guard, gloves, and gum shield, I approached the centre stage. As the referee grasped both our hands, the judges began to speak. I mentally prepared for defeat by telling myself I had lost and that it was all okay. But my hand was raised and I surged with joy as I claimed sweet victory. It was an electrifying moment, the culmination of tireless effort finally swinging in my favour.\nExiting the ring, I proudly accepted my All-Ireland medal and hugged my coach, who shared my triumph. I returned to my family who shared my glee. On the way back in the car, I spoke to my brother saying “You know it’s strange, doing this has been the most exhausting thing I’ve ever done but I’ve never felt calmer inside.” He told me he had noticed it too.\nMonths of intense training aimed at a singular goal had unexpectedly built a newfound confidence that manifested as a feeling of calmness. It was like stepping into a quiet room for the first time, where once, there had always been a buzzing noise. I realised that confidence was less about grandeur or and more about easing anxiety and finding comfort within oneself. If you want to build confidence, I believe in aiming for something challenging and meaningful. Then, pursue it with all you have."

    "text": "Conclusion\n\nYou can’t connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backward. - Steve Jobs\n\nReflecting on the past four years of my life has been a meaningful endeavour. What once felt like mistakes to be forgotten have transformed into pivotal moments of my story. Without them, I wouldn’t possess the insights I do today. This realisation reinforces the idea that mistakes aren’t an obstacle to growth; they are an essential ingredient. Steve Jobs’ quote recognises that clarity is often not gained until you stop and take time to look back. Looking ahead, I feel confident about placing myself in situations where I’m likely to make mistakes, recognising the opportunities for learning they bring.\nI firmly believe that one’s response to life events matters more than the events themselves. This perspective acknowledges that challenges are inevitable but you always have the power to take control of your life instead of letting externalities dictate it. In this process, self-reflection serves as an invaluable tool, allowing you to integrate and embrace your past mistakes.\nNow, I invite you to contemplate the three greatest mistakes in your life. Write out your experiences before and after each mistake and how they impacted you. Carry out a brainstorming session to extract lessons from each mistake. Write down any and all types of lessons—this will be eye-opening. Another takeaway from Jobs is that you can connect the dots however you see fit. Initially, I thought I had eight lessons ready to go, but after a comprehensive brainstorm, I generated 176, this means I had 22 sets of lessons to choose from. The key is to strike a balance between specificity (tailored to the event) and generalisability (applicable to various aspects of life).\nAs you select lessons for this series, prioritise honesty, accuracy, and coherence. Post-brainstorm, reframe your experiences through the lens of the lessons learned. Consider how your actions contributed to learning the lesson rather than making the mistake, reframing the narrative. Subsequently, redraft and edit your work into a cohesive story.\nTo embrace self-reflection, identify your mistakes, focus on the lessons learned and start writing."

    "section": "Taking A Stand - Captain America: The Winter Soldier (Henry Jackman)",
    "text": "Taking A Stand - Captain America: The Winter Soldier (Henry Jackman)\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier is my favourite movie. In this movie, Captain America (Steve Rogers) struggles to find his footing in the modern world after being under the ice for 70 years. While coming to terms with this new world, he uncovers unsettling secrets about the people he had once laid down his life for. The composition “Taking a Stand” accompanies the pivotal scene when Steve is on the run from S.H.I.E.L.D. They cast him as a traitor after he finds out about Hydra’s roots within S.H.I.E.L.D’s organisation and pursues what he believes is right. This is a key moment in the Winter Soldier and Steve’s character arc across the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This scene builds upon the scene in Captain America: The First Avenger when he disobeys direct orders against infiltrating the Hydra base to free his captured comrades. Steve exercises his own judgement and continues the path to becoming an independent character with his own set of values. We see this come to a head in Captain America: Civil War when he opposes the Sokovia Accords. I expect ChatGPT to discuss these key motifs and themes.\n\n\nMy Prompt\n\nImagine you are a film score and soundtrack expert who has an undying passion for analysing the meaning behind the music composed for movies and films. You have studied the character of Steve Rogers (Captain America) specifically in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nI want you to discuss the importance of the piece of music “Taking a Stand” in Captain America: The Winter Soldier for forwarding the plot and the role it plays in developing Steve’s character arc in the MCU.\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\nAs a film score and soundtrack expert, I can confidently say that music plays a vital role in shaping the emotional impact of a movie or film. The piece of music “Taking a Stand” from Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a perfect example of how music can forward the plot while also contributing to the character development of the protagonist, Steve Rogers.\nThe piece of music “Taking a Stand” is a recurring theme throughout the film, representing the heroic nature of Captain America and his unwavering dedication to standing up for what is right. The music is first introduced during the opening action sequence, where Steve, aka Captain America, and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D agents rescue hostages from pirates on the Lemurian Star. The music sets the tone for the rest of the film, establishing Captain America as a symbol of hope and justice.\nThroughout the film, we see Steve struggling to reconcile his old-fashioned values with the complex and morally ambiguous world he finds himself in. He is forced to question his loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D. and the government and faces betrayal from those he once trusted. The music “Taking a Stand” serves as a reminder of his unwavering moral compass and his commitment to standing up for what is right, even in the face of adversity.\nIn the film’s climactic scene, where Steve and his friend Sam Wilson confront the Winter Soldier, the music swells to a crescendo, emphasising the gravity of the situation and the high stakes involved. The music is a testament to Steve’s growth as a character, showing how he has evolved from a simple soldier to a true leader who inspires those around him to do the right thing.\nIn conclusion, the piece of music “Taking a Stand” is a critical element of Captain America: The Winter Soldier’s soundtrack, both forwarding the plot and contributing to the development of Steve’s character arc. The music serves as a powerful reminder of Steve’s unwavering dedication to standing up for what is right, even in the face of impossible odds, making him a true hero and an inspiration to audiences worldwide.\n\nChatGPT begins by agreeing with me about the importance of the piece of music. Unfortunately, ChatGPT misses that “Taking a Stand” is a distinct piece that accompanies a specific action sequence in the film. Instead, ChatGPT takes “Taking a Stand” as more of a musical theme and reflection of Steve’s character traits. “Taking a Stand” is not introduced in the opening scene, “Lemurian Star” is. It is not played in the final scene either.\nChatGPT is not recognising “Taking a Stand” as a standalone piece of music and instead as a broader theme in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. This is disappointing. A standalone composition in an action movie is rare. Action music is usually formulaic, echoing familiar patterns.\nChatGPT comments that the music illustrates Steve’s character growth “from a simple soldier to a true leader”. This is a hallmark of his character. Let’s explore this further.\n\n\nSecond Prompt\n\nCan you give examples of unwavering dedication to standing up for what is right, even in the face of impossible odds from the whole Trilogy and how the role the piece of music “Taking a Stand” (played during his escape from the S.H.I.E.L.D. compound) plays among these examples.”\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\n*Certainly, there are several examples throughout the Captain America Trilogy that demonstrate Steve Rogers’ unwavering dedication to standing up for what is right, even in the face of impossible odds.\nOne such example is in Captain America: The First Avenger, where Steve, despite being physically weak and frail, repeatedly tries to enlist in the military to fight in World War II. His persistence and determination eventually lead him to be selected for a top-secret government experiment that turns him into the super-soldier Captain America. The music “Taking a Stand” is not present in this film, but we can see how Steve’s unwavering dedication is a constant theme throughout his journey.\nAnother example is in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, where Steve becomes disillusioned with S.H.I.E.L.D.’s actions and uncovers a conspiracy within the organisation. Despite facing seemingly insurmountable odds, Steve decides to take a stand against those who would use their power for personal gain, ultimately leading to the collapse of S.H.I.E.L.D. The piece of music “Taking a Stand” plays during Steve’s escape from the S.H.I.E.L.D. compound, emphasising the gravity of the situation and the stakes involved. The music also highlights Steve’s determination to do what is right, even if it means going against authority figures he once trusted.\nIn Captain America: Civil War, Steve once again finds himself at odds with his former teammates in the Avengers, who have aligned themselves with the government’s demands for accountability. Despite being on the run and facing a powerful new enemy, Steve remains committed to his beliefs and refuses to compromise his principles. The piece of music “Taking a Stand” plays during the final battle between Steve and Iron Man, underscoring the emotional weight of the confrontation and Steve’s conviction in his actions.\nIn conclusion, the piece of music “Taking a Stand” serves as a recurring theme throughout the Captain America Trilogy, emphasising Steve Rogers’ unwavering dedication to standing up for what is right, even in the face of seemingly impossible odds. From his persistence in enlisting in the military to his fight against corrupt organisations, Steve’s commitment to his beliefs is a constant thread throughout his journey, and the music serves as a powerful reminder of his heroism and bravery.”*\n\nI’m satisfied with this response. ChatGPT provides examples from each movie of Captain America’s independence and integrity. It identifies its presence in The Winter Solider, and absence in The First Avenger, but it makes a mistake with when it says it was in the final battle of Captain America: Civil War. The final battle scene was underscored by the piece “Clash”. In this analysis, ChatGPT describes how a soundtrack impacts character themes but struggles with placing the sountrack in the right moment of the film. Saying it another way, ChatGPT can describe niche topics subjectively but not precisely. Niche topics lack training data. Therefore, performance on precise, complex tasks lags in these areas. This is the crux of the hallucination problem. For subjective questions, there is no true right answer and ChatGPT can get away with “waffling”. But questions with only one true answer stifle ChatGPT. We can demonstrate this when posing complex maths problems to ChatGPT. There is almost always error. It’s plausible to attribute this to its stochastic nature."

    "text": "Introduction\nChatGPT has become a subject of intense controversy. Views on this large language model (LLM) range widely, some see it as a powerful tool for the future of learning while others fear it will stifle innovation and creativity. One significant question is “can we rely on a Generative Artificial Intelligence’s (GAI) expertise on niche subject matters?” Like any technology, there are benefits and drawbacks. On the one hand it appears to be knowledgeable in many domains. However, ChatGPT is also known for hallucinating (stating nonfactual information with great certainty), putting its credibility into question.\nTo address this, I am evaluating ChatGPT’s knowledge on a topic I’m passionate about: film scores and their impact on the cinematic experience.\nFor this analysis, I focus on three genres; thriller, action and romance. While characters, themes, and plot are commonly discussed aspects of a film but a film’s soundtrack is overlooked and underappreciated.\nBy following along with this three part series, you’ll develop a brief understanding of:\n\nChatGPT’s strengths and weaknesses.\nA film soundtrack’s role in cinema."

    "section": "Why Do We Fall - The Dark Knight Rises (Hans Zimmer)",
    "text": "Why Do We Fall - The Dark Knight Rises (Hans Zimmer)\nWhy Do We Fall is among my favourite pieces of film music. The title is half of a line of dialogue given by Alfred to Bruce in the Dark Knight Rises.\n\nWhy do we fall Mr. Wayne? So we can learn to pick ourselves up.\n\nThe musical piece captures Bruce’s rise from The Pit at the end of the second act, on his return to save Gotham. The climb involves a long ascent up the pit wall with a final jump to a ledge at the top to secure his escape.\nThe music begins with strings as Bruce approaches the wall to make his climb. In the film, this is accompanied by a chant by the fellow inmates which translated means ‘rise’. As Bruce ascends the wall, the music intensifies and pace quickens using the brass’s power and the percussion’s rhythmic drive. As he makes the final leap of faith to escape, the music comes to a crescendo with a cliffhanging pause. In previous attempts to escape, Bruce fell short before the ledge causing him to fall. But this time he succeeds and the music reciprocates his redemption through a powerful finish.\nThematically, Bruce’s rise from the pit symbolises a pivotal moment in his physical and emotional character development for how he faces adversity. He not only regains his physical strength but also learns to embrace fear as a potent driver to escape the pit.\nThe drums mirror his heart beat. At the beginning, they are calm like Bruce. As he rises up the wall, the drums become more powerful, akin to his elevating heart rate and his acceptance of fear. The moment before the jump is when the drums and his heart rate are most intense and he feels the greatest fear. This fear is what drives him to successfully land the jump.\n\n\nMy Prompt\n\nImagine you are a film score and soundtrack expert who has an undying passion for analysing the meaning behind the music composed for movies and films.\nCould you discuss the meaning behind the piece ‘Why Do We Fall?’ and how Hans Zimmer combines specific musical instruments/sounds to communicate this meaning?\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\nAbsolutely! “Why Do We Fall?” is a powerful piece of music composed by Hans Zimmer for the movie The Dark Knight Rises. It is an instrumental track that plays during some of the most emotional and pivotal moments of the film. Let’s explore its meaning and importance.\nFirst, it’s essential to note that “Why Do We Fall?” is a recurring motif throughout the entire Dark Knight trilogy. It first appears in Batman Begins during the scene where Bruce Wayne is training to become Batman. This piece of music signifies Bruce’s struggle to overcome his fears and become the hero that Gotham needs.\nIn The Dark Knight Rises, “Why Do We Fall?” takes on a new significance. The film opens with Bruce Wayne broken and defeated, having lost everything he held dear. This track plays during the scene where Bruce is trying to climb out of the prison he’s trapped in. The music serves to underscore his struggle to overcome his physical and emotional limitations, and ultimately, his triumph over them. This theme is woven throughout the film, as Bruce Wayne, now physically and emotionally broken, must find a way to rise up and save Gotham once again.\nIn many ways, “Why Do We Fall?” is the heart of The Dark Knight Rises. It represents the film’s central theme of perseverance and the idea that even when we fall, we must get back up and keep fighting. This message is particularly poignant in light of the film’s release, which came shortly after the tragic shooting in Aurora, Colorado. The film’s message of hope in the face of adversity resonated with audiences, and “Why Do We Fall?” became a rallying cry for those seeking to find meaning in the wake of tragedy.\nIn conclusion, “Why Do We Fall?” is a powerful piece of music that encapsulates the themes of perseverance and hope that are central to The Dark Knight Rises. Its importance lies not just in its use in the film but also in the way it has become a symbol of resilience and strength for audiences around the world.\n\nFor this prompt, I wanted ChatGPT to discuss not only the piece of music, but also its role in the trilogy. It identified the moment it was played during the rise from the pit, followed by discussing broadly, the thematic meaning behind the phrase and how it relates to the character of Bruce Wayne himself. I am very happy with this response as it addressed the key points I was focusing on; how Bruce not only has the physical struggle of escaping the pit but also has the emotional limitation of accepting fear.\nI was surprised by its mention of the Colorado shooting. The film’s impact on society was not a focus of my question. This emphasises the need for precise language when interacting with ChatGPT.\nI had expected ChatGPT would comment on how drums mimic Bruce’s heartbeat beginning at rest and then building up as the scene grows in intensity. After a second prompt asking “In the musical piece, I believe the drum mirrors Bruce’s heartbeat. Can you discuss this Idea?” ChatGPT responded in agreement, elaborating how the drum mimicking a heartbeat is a common technique used in film scores to build tension and enhance the audience’s experience."

    "section": "Mia and Sebastian’s Theme - La La Land, Manny and Nellie’s Theme - Babylon (Justin Hurwitz)",
    "text": "Mia and Sebastian’s Theme - La La Land, Manny and Nellie’s Theme - Babylon (Justin Hurwitz)\nJustin Hurwitz is one of my favourite film score composers and often collaborates with director Damien Chazelle. Chazelle believes a film’s score is as important as the characters and plot when making a film. I appreciate his approach, as you can learn a lot from listening to his film’s music in isolation.\nTwo of Chazelle’s films, La La Land and Babylon, share a common theme of unrequited love. The romantic themes include “Mia and Sebastian” (La La Land) and “Manny and Nellie” (Babylon). The name order may indicate the character’s importance. I believe Mia and Manny are the true protagonists of their respective films. I want to explore the similarities and contrasts between their themes as reflected in the relationships.\nMia and Sebastian’s theme is romantic, warm, and sad. The piece ends chaotically, emphasising the relationship’s unsustainable nature. Manny and Nellie’s theme consists of a crazy, romantic melody that complements the story’s tone and the era in which it is set. Its wistful and melancholic quality also illustrates the relationship’s impracticality.\nBoth relationships are built upon the two characters’ shared drive to follow their dreams. In La La Land, there is a line: “Here is to one’s who dream, foolish as they may seem.” In Babylon, Manny says, “I always wanted to be part of something bigger. Something that lasts, that means something.” Hope is a sentiment that often accompanies dreams. But as I listen to their themes, I only hear hopelessness.\nMia and Sebastian’s theme is filled with peaks and troughs, like a roller coaster of hope and disappointment that runs off track. The eloquence and depth in their theme contrast with Manny and Nellie’s carefree and raw tone. This disparity highlights the frivolity of the Babylon relationship but also the lower socioeconomic status of its characters.\nI want ChatGPT to compare these two themes and how they reflect the traits of both relationships.\n\n\nMy Prompt\n\n*Imagine you are a film score and soundtrack expert who has an undying passion for analysing the meaning behind the music composed for movies and films. You are an avid fan of the work of Damien Chazelle and Justin Hurwitz, and in particular, you have a deep understanding of the relationships between Mia and Sebastian in La La Land and Manny and Nellie in Babylon.\nI want you to compare the similarities and differences between the two pieces of music, “Mia and Sebastian’s Theme” and “Manny and Nellie’s Theme.” Discuss how each theme contributes to and reflects the characters’ relationships in each movie.*\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\nAs a film score and soundtrack expert, I would be thrilled to discuss the music of Damien Chazelle and Justin Hurwitz, particularly the similarities and differences between the themes of two romantic relationships, Mia and Sebastian in La La Land and Manny and Nellie in Babylon.\nFirstly, let’s talk about “Mia and Sebastian’s Theme” from La La Land. This beautiful piece of music is the signature tune of the film, featuring a tender romantic melody played on piano with a simple, repetitive accompaniment. The music reflects the dreamy, whimsical quality of Mia and Sebastian’s relationship as they fall in love and pursue their respective artistic passions. The theme perfectly captures the bittersweet essence of their love story as they try to navigate their professional ambitions and their feelings for each other.\nOn the other hand, “Manny and Nellie’s Theme” from Babylon has a different vibe. The music is more melancholic, with a haunting melody played on strings and woodwinds. This theme reflects the intense, tragic nature of Manny and Nellie’s relationship, which is defined by their struggles with addiction and the harsh realities of life on the streets. The music conveys a sense of hopelessness and despair, as well as a deep emotional connection between the two characters, who are united by their shared experiences.\nDespite the differences between the two themes, there are some similarities in the way that they contribute to and reflect the characters’ relationships in each movie. Both themes are used as leitmotifs throughout the films, appearing in different variations and arrangements to underscore key moments in the story. They also serve as a musical shorthand for the character’s emotions and relationships, allowing the audience to connect with them on a deeper level.\nIn summary, “Mia and Sebastian’s Theme” and “Manny and Nellie’s Theme” are two beautiful pieces of music that reflect the complex, nuanced relationships between the characters in their respective films. While they have different musical styles and tonalities, they both serve as powerful tools to convey the emotions and experiences of the characters and to draw the audience into their world.\n\nChatGPT exceeded my expectations by providing a more accurate summary of the two themes and relationships in each movie. ChatGPT points out the themes’ differences in musical styles and tonalities. Words such as ‘dreamy’, ‘bittersweet’, and ‘tragic’ elegantly describe the themes. I felt these words on the tip of my tongue, but I couldn’t think of them. ChatGPT exhibits precise word use. I appreciated how ChatGPT uses terminology like leitmotifs and eloquently communicates a point like ‘serve as a musical shorthand for the characters’ emotions and relationships.’ ChatGPT has delivered a remarkable piece of writing and showcases the ability to craft impressive cinematic commentary."

    "text": "Conclusion:\nThis series set out to investigate ChatGPT’s expertise in the film score domain. By carrying out this experiment, we learned about ChatGPT’s strengths and shortcomings. ChatGPT has an impressive knowledge of film scores that would surprise many who share such knowledge, but it’s not perfect.\nThe types of mistakes ChatGPT makes would not be spotted by subject matter novices.\nTherefore, relying on ChatGPT for information on a complex or niche topic is risky. In many cases, ChatGPT is right. But when it is wrong, a novice wouldn’t possess the understanding or skills to check its validity. That is my primary concern. Not that ChatGPT can be wrong, but that you’d struggle to identify it.\nGiven these considerations, ChatGPT’s true strength lies in assisting those who already have subject matter knowledge. It’s powerful when trying to organise thoughts into structured, coherent ideas."

Reflecting on my first year, it dawned on me that I’d dedicated an awful lot of time to studying. I worried that my future self might regret not having indulged in the “full college experience.” At the time, I believed university fun mainly revolved around drinking and partying. So, naturally, I figured if I wanted to have more fun, I should drink and party more while leaving hard stuff like studying, working out, and meal prep to the waist side. And that’s exactly what I did. I found myself attending regular house parties and drinking.\nOver time, I started feeling a sense of freedom, thinking I was finally “letting loose” and truly getting “the full college experience.” But then came a turning point.

    "text": "💡  What type of people do you work well with?         When pursuing your goals, do your expectations usually meet reality?         What are your career priorities and how do they impact your quality of life?\n\nINTRA (INtegrated TRAining) placement was a breath of fresh air after the events of the previous semester. I looked forward to intriguing work and being part of a team. However, I held concerns about the working environment. Growing up, media often depicted a bleak view of the professional world, featuring burnt-out employees, horrible bosses, and draining work, think of Fight Club, Horrible Bosses, or Mad Men.\nWhile I recognised these portrayals were exaggerated for effect, I worried about any underlying truths echoed by anecdotal evidence I had gathered over the years. I wondered, would my manager be a narcissistic, egomaniac!? Would the culture be so competitive and toxic that everyone saw each other as instruments to be used for their gain!? Would the work be so mind-numbing that I would wake up every morning before work thinking, “Oh no, not again!”?\nFortunately, I had worked with the company in a previous internship and any concerns I had proved to be unfounded. People were collaborative rather than competitive. We worked together and helped each other out. I valued the office setting for the spontaneous discussions that wouldn’t have been possible remotely from home. During lunch, engaging conversations with the team ranged from personal experiences to ongoing projects. Post-work meet-ups always had a crowd making it easier to meet people and get to know them better. I had the autonomy to think of ideas and turn them into projects.

    "text": "💡  What type of people do you work well with?         When pursuing your goals, do your expectations usually meet reality?         What are your career priorities and how do they impact your quality of life?\n\nINTRA (INtegrated TRAining) placement was a breath of fresh air after the events of the previous semester. I looked forward to intriguing work and being part of a team. However, I held concerns about the working environment. Growing up, media often depicted a bleak view of the professional world, featuring burnt-out employees, horrible bosses, and draining work, think of Fight Club, Horrible Bosses, or Mad Men.\nWhile I recognised these portrayals were exaggerated for effect, I worried about any underlying truths echoed by anecdotal evidence I had gathered over the years. I wondered, would my manager be a narcissistic, egomaniac!? Would the culture be so competitive and toxic that everyone saw each other as instruments to be used for their gain!? Would the work be so mind-numbing that I would wake up every morning before work thinking, “Oh no, not again!”?\nFortunately, I had worked with the company in a previous internship and any concerns I had proved to be unfounded. People were collaborative rather than competitive. We worked together and helped each other out. I valued the office setting for the spontaneous discussions that wouldn’t have been possible remotely from home. During lunch, engaging conversations with the team ranged from personal experiences to ongoing projects. Post-work meet-ups always had a crowd making it easier to meet people and get to know them better. I had the autonomy to think of ideas and turn them into projects.

    "text": "The plan was straightforward: train hard for seven weeks, rest for one, and finish with five weeks of sharpening. It didn’t stay simple for long.\nI followed a focused but demanding schedule:\n\nMon: Club\nTue: Gym Strength\nWed: Club\nThu: Club\nFri: Gym Explosive\nSat: Rest\nSun: Footwork & Technique\n\nAt DCU Boxing Club, Derek, Colin, and Terry run the sessions. Between them, they’ve decades of experience, working with all levels, from novices to Olympians. Derek likes to say, “Boxing shows you who you are.” Colin likes to test your limits. And if you ask Terry what he thinks of boxing, he might say, “tough sport”. They’ve a real passion for boxing and are dedicated to helping us develop our skills.\nClub sessions followed a familiar pattern – warm up, shadow boxing, technical skills in school sparring, and drilling combinations with (seemingly endless) rounds of bag work. Finally, we put it all together in open sparring. “Finally” you thought? Oh no, do your skipping and core work first, then you’re free to go.\nFor me, club sessions were a high priority. I aimed to show up well-fuelled, ready to work, and with a positive attitude.\nThis plan was more intense than I was used to. Managing stress and training load, both inside and outside the gym, became critical. Each week, I’d look ahead at what I had planned and see if I needed to make any adjustments.\nI set myself one rule: no more than two hard spars a week. But it was tricky; on good nights, I was eager to get in and on bad ones, I didn’t want to look like I was ducking out.\nI logged each session after leaving the gym. I learned early that writing out each session was gruelling, so I switched to ChatGPT voice notes. I’d ramble through each session and ask it to give a breakdown of what worked, what didn’t, and a focus for the next session.\nThe gym work was simple but deliberate – everything needed to transfer to boxing. Tuesdays were for strength: squats, deadlifts, pull-ups and shoulder press, keeping reps low. Fridays kept the movements but swapped weight for speed, incorporating jumping squats and deadlifts, sternum-to-bar pull-ups, and the landmine press, which I liked, especially for improving foot, hip, and torso coordination.\nSundays were at my own pace. I explored and played with new techniques and footwork, and finished with cardio. Early in camp, I did steady-state, and later on, I’d perform sprints.\nAfter each session, I always stretched for at least 5 minutes. The small habit made a big difference, I felt looser and less sore across the week.\nThe first few weeks went to plan – six sessions a week, knocking them off one by one. I felt stronger, my skills were sharpening, and I started using mental visualisation during sparring with mixed success. The training load was heavy, but I believed I was managing it.\nThings kicked off in week 4 with our first external spar of the year – a chance to blow off the cobwebs. External spars are of a higher intensity. They’re not real fight intensity, but there’s no friendly familiarity. Most gyms ban filming to protect boxers’ privacy. It’s a pity, you can learn a thing or two from watching the spars back. The night before, I did a deload gym session to make sure I was fresh for Cabra. I usually avoid small tweaks, but external spars were a priority.\nWednesday, January 22nd, 19:30, we arrived in Cabra BC. I stepped through the ropes and looked across the ring at a stocky 80+ kg lad, staring me down and ready to rock— Oh Jaysus, here we go. From the get-go, he switched between throwing bombs on the inside (nearly took my head off) and gliding around on the outside.\nThe second opponent was taller and longer, someone I’d fought before. He had a high work rate, and his shots were clean. I stayed composed, blocked plenty, but it was clear my conditioning needed work.\nAs I left, I noticed my second opponent still on the bags, practicing combinations. For him, the session wasn’t over yet.\nThe very next day at the club, I sparred again. Third spar of the week – breaking my rule. Two rounds in, I was sluggish, static, and getting hit far too often. I felt angry at myself over the decision to get in. But after talking with the coach, I realised that while sparring mightn’t have been the best call, you don’t always get the luxury of perfect conditions.\nA week later, on Wednesday in Mulhuddart BC, I felt sharper. Two bigger opponents, but both at my weight – one dangerous on the inside, the other slick and elusive on the outside. I controlled distance better, countered cleanly, and spotted openings I’d missed before. I left happy, and my coach was too.\nCherry Orchard BC was a different story. The following evening we were melting getting into the ring. The ceiling heating turned the place into a sauna. I was first in, switching between one southpaw and one orthodox opponent. Each change confused me, and I took too long to adapt.  But with the southpaw, when I finally parried his jab and fired mine through, it landed. Afterwards, my coach told me to stop waiting – take control early,  dictate the pace, and don’t let the opponent settle into a rhythm. Throw first and throw often. I left the ring wrecked, but still finished the session with three rounds on the bags and four rounds skipping.\nComing into the February Bank Holiday weekend, I was drained from the two external spars and heavy training during the week. In my explosive session on Friday, I focused on speed by halving weight. After resting Saturday, I was back with the footwork and cardio on Sunday, followed by a late-night event, where I didn’t get home until 3 am. Still, I trained Monday as usual and had a strong strength session Tuesday, hitting new weights on all lifts.\nIn Mulhuddart on Wednesday, I sparred with the same two guys. One had figured me out – closed the distance fast and kept the pressure high. Against the other, I worked the body and added second-phase attacks. While I caught most shots on my guard, I took a few hard shots as well.\nBy the end of Week 5, I’d banked 30 sessions: 7 club, 4 external spars, 8 technical/footwork, and 11 gym.\nOn paper, things looked great! In reality, I was edging towards the red. My plan to mitigate the risks of overtraining had held so far. But as Eisenhower said,\n\nPlans are worthless, planning is everything.\n\nOr in Mike Tyson’s words\n\nEveryone has a plan until they get hit in the face.\n\nAnd I, had been hit in the face. Tune in next week to see how that plan panned out."

    "text": "Over my time in boxing, I’ve had to cut weight eight times—some for carded fights, others for exhibitions. I’d group those cuts into four types: Long (&gt;5 weeks), Medium (2–5 weeks), Short (&lt;2 weeks), and Maintenance (2 weeks after another weigh-in).\nThe long cuts – my first time dropping down to 69kg and 67kg – were the most painful. I was inexperienced, made mistakes, built fragile plans that collapsed under pressure. Medium cuts were smoother but still rough, especially when I had to drop weight rapidly near the end. I noticed a predictable rhythm:\n\nWeek 1 – this feels good\nWeek 2 – this is a good idea\nWeek 3 – this might not be a good idea\nWeek 4 – I’m drained\nWeek 5+ – get me out of this.\n\nShort cuts came with short notice fights and went something like this:\n“Diarmuid, there’s a fight on the following weekend, are you up for it?”\n“Sounds good, is there a weigh-in?”\n“There is.”\nMaintenance cuts felt like limbo – staying down rather than getting down. If the previous cut went well, it was peaceful. If not, it just prolonged the suffering.\nAcross every type of cut, the core tactics were the same:\n\nWater loading which involved ramping up to 6–8 litres 7 days before weigh-in and tapering down to 0.5L the day before.\nReducing carbs, fibre, and salt—3–4 days out to drop 1–2kg of water weight.\n\nAfter attending a nutrition talk in January, I realised I’d been underfuelling my training. I used to rely on low-calorie, high-satiety foods like fruit, veg, and protein to keep hunger at bay while staying under my calorie target. But I wasn’t fuelling training properly using carbohydrates. What I learned was that by timing carbs before and after training, I could support performance and recovery without derailing my weight cut. That was the principle, anyway. At the time, I was still figuring out how to apply it.\nAlong with underfuelling came restrictive eating.\nDuring my longer cuts, I thought the only way to stay within my calorie limit was to cut out foods I enjoyed, like chocolate, entirely. That mindset made the system fragile. I’d be underfuelled for training, tightly controlling everything I ate with any deviation feeling like failure.\nMy first time cutting, I had a terrible habit of scrolling through Instagram food accounts thinking it would help with cravings. It didn’t. If anything, it just stirred up temptation and frustration.\nInevitably, the pressure would build and the pendulum swung the other way.\nA small treat would sometimes spiral, eating much more than planned, causing a spike in weight.\nOver time, I’ve realised restriction can be more about your state of mind. It’s tied to how comfortable you are with including flexibility in a plan. Even a flexible plan can be sabotaged by a rigid mind.\nSince then, I’ve created more balance, I still slip up like parties or weekends away, but the impact is smaller and the rebound is quicker. Practicing mindful eating has helped me enjoy the foods I like each day in moderation and to understand what type of food leads to satisfaction or spikes cravings.\nLarge sharing bars with chewy or crunchy bits tend to trigger a pursuit-driven loop where you’re always chasing the next bite. There are no natural stop points. Small milk chocolate bars, on the other hand, are individually wrapped and portioned – stop points are built in. Each piece can melt in the mouth which slow everything down and creating a feeling of satisfaction.\nAcross this training camp, I noticed a shift in my perspective, I fuelled each training session leading to a higher performance and while weight didn’t go to plan, it was a step in the right direction. It’s much easier to execute a strategy when you’re comfortable with a margin of error. So when I was 7 days out with 4kg to drop, I didn’t panic. It was unfortunate that I was in this situation but it wasn’t the end of the world. I had a plan and I knew I could follow through.\nOn Sunday 16th March, I increased my water intake up to 6 litres. Monday was Paddy’s day, so I did my own session. By Tuesday, the effects of the cut began setting in – impatience, self-consciousness, and sensitivity in conversation.\nBy Wednesday, I felt that familiar sensation: anxiety in the body. Shallow breath, tension, and that internal alarm bell saying something’s wrong. I felt a pressure to perform building. The previous week had been electric, and I expected myself to repeat it despite being in a cut.\nTraining started well. I was sharp in shadowboxing and school sparring. But in open sparring, we were asked to raise the intensity. My partner landed three clean backhands and my nose began bleeding uncontrollably. I stepped out to clean it up. But when I went back in, it started bleeding again. I had to stop the spar and I felt humiliated.\nIt brought back memories of one year earlier, my nose was busted in during an external spar the week before Porto. My nose reopened during the Porto fight, almost stopping the bout. Now it was happening again.\nI needed space so I stepped into the next hall, and skipped and stretched in silence.\nDuring the cool down, my mind spiralled with thoughts of anger, blame, and self-criticism. I felt I should have learned from last year. But beneath the anger was sadness and fear. I was upset it had happened and scared that it would derail next week.\nWhen I got home, I accepted that it was my choice to spar and take the risk, blame wasn’t helping anyone. I also had put too much weight on the spar. It wasn’t ideal but it didn’t determine the outcome next week.\nBy Thursday, I was 3 days out. I dropped carbs, fibre, and salt, and began tapering water. That evening at training, I didn’t spar, the risk outweighed the benefit. On Friday, my energy lowered significantly. I fasted from Saturday midday and dropped water to 0.5 litres. Going to bed Saturday evening, I was 70kg.\nSunday morning, I woke up at 68.7kg with 1.7kg to lose. I prepared a long and controlled sweat session.\nI did 6 rounds of 12 minutes each:\n\n3 minutes skipping\n3 minutes shadowboxing\n3 minutes jogging in place with high knees\n30 seconds squats\n30 seconds pushups\n1 minute jumping jacks\n1 minute arm circles\n\nI wore full sweat gear including a full body lycra base layer, heavy joggers, thermal socks, shoes, long sleeve gym top, half-zip, waterproof jacket with gloves, a scarf, and a hat\nBetween rounds, I took 3-minute breaks. Halfway, I took a 15-minute break lying on the bed in full sweat gear, wrapped in blankets and a towel. After the six rounds, I took a 30-minute break in the same setup. Each break allowed time for my body to sweat out excess water weight.\nI was uncomfortable, but alert. Cutting this much water in a short time carries risk, so I watched for any dizziness or light-headedness. Luckily, I felt a clear focus the whole way through. I just had to stick to the plan. And I did.\nI weighed in at 66.5kg meaning I had dropped 2.2kg during the sweat session. At the venue, I spotted a few familiar faces from external spars. But one guy caught my eye, a southpaw who I’d watched in the Intervarsity Finals at 67kg. I wondered if we’d meet each other.\nAfter the weigh-in, I sipped Dioralyte and slowly ate a rice pudding to reintroduce food. Across the day, I had light, high-carb meals, for example, pasta with tomato sauce and chicken or toast with banana and honey.\nBy evening, I felt clear and calm. The hardest part was done. I’d made weight without panic. I had followed a plan and trusted the process. I didn’t feel wrecked. I felt ready.\nNow, it was time to shift focus and prepare to step into the ring.\nNext week, I take you through my final preparations for my quarter-final fight at the Dublin Novice Championships 2025."

    "text": "In June 2024, we had a small dinner with the DCU boxing club, one of the lads was moving abroad, and I found myself sitting across from Oran, my club mate and sparring partner. We reflected on the season with mixed feelings about our performances.\nI had entered the Porto Box Cup at 71kg and had lost my opening fight against a bigger, more skilled opponent who went on to win the tournament.\nDespite losing our respective competitions, Oran and I believed that with focused preparation, we could return next year and compete at the level we knew we were capable of.\nI kept training 3 to 5 times a week, testing new techniques in sparring and exhibitions throughout the summer and into the autumn.\nIn September 2024, I had an exhibition in Manchester that left a mark. It was my first stoppage, where the fight was ended early because I was being overpowered. Last-minute changes before the bout threw me. I entered the ring scattered and tense, my thoughts in a frenzy. My performance reflected that state, and the disappointment stung. I’d hoped the fight would show my progress. Instead, it exposed my shortcomings.\nAfterwards, I sat down wondering how I’d lost composure so quickly. Over the following days, it became clear that mental preparation mattered just as much as physical. If I couldn’t maintain composure under pressure, I wouldn’t perform, like shooting a cannon from a canoe. I doubted whether I could handle pressure at all, if I was someone who always caved.\nI began learning about sports psychology and how athletes like Michael Phelps used mental rehearsal to prepare for the unexpected, like his goggles filling with water during the 2008 Olympics final, and still went on to win gold and break the world record.\nIn November, I started a mental visualisation practice to help me stay composed when things didn’t go to plan. I wanted to build the kind of mindset that could hold steady under pressure, to manage fear and get the job done, no matter what came up.\nOver Christmas, I took a complete rest from training, as I had finished an aggressive weight cut in the start of December and I needed time to recover. At a family dinner on New Year’s Day, boxing came up. Before I knew it, I said “I’m aiming to win the Porto Box Cup in April.”\nSaying it out loud reinforced it and made the decision real. I’d always wanted to pursue something ambitious in sport. But until now, nothing had stuck. Boxing was different. It offered a chance to test myself physically and mentally, with no excuses.\nIn the past, I often told myself I’d ‘try my best.’ But in hindsight, I realised I wasn’t aiming to succeed; I was playing it safe. This time, I was fully committed, no half measures. I wanted to win. Porto felt like it was just within arm’s reach, and I believed with the right preparation, I could produce a performance I’d be proud of.\nAt the heart of it, this is the story of pursuing a meaningful goal, one that invigorates and intimidates you. It either pulls you forward or quietly lingers until you’ve done something about it.\nThis is part one of a 10-part series, released weekly, tracing the twists and turns as they unfolded.\nOn January 2nd, the countdown began. I had 13 weeks. Next week’s post picks up from there. I’ll walk through the first five weeks, where the plan started to take shape, and how early progress gave me confidence.\nIn the meantime, think about one meaningful goal you’ve pursued before.\n\nWhat made it meaningful?\nWhat was at stake for you, personally?\nHow did it change you?"

The app categorised emotions based on energy (high/low) and pleasantness (pleasant/unpleasant).\n\n🟨 High-energy, pleasant: happy, motivated\n\n🟥 High-energy, unpleasant: angry, anxious\n\n🟩 Low-energy, pleasant: calm, compassionate\n\n🟦 Low-energy, unpleasant: tired, sad\n\nI tracked both mood and context: where I was, what I was doing, and who I was with. I log entries in the morning and afternoon, describing how I feel:\n\nUpon waking\nBefore work\nAfter work\nBefore training\n\nLogging my mood helps me pause, check in, and relax before continuing. This is particularly helpful before an activity (e.g., work or training, hence the timing), as taking a moment to relax can make a significant difference in productivity at work or performance during training.\nOver 504 days, I’ve created 917 entries using 125 emotions. I’ve learned that emotions are fleeting; usually, they come and go, and are forgotten about. But when a pattern emerges from gathering them each week, you begin to see interesting things.\nAcross December and January, my emotions followed a pattern of blue → green → yellow → blue tracking getting sick over Christmas, recovering, getting back to training, and my response over the first 5 weeks. When you are training hard, all you need is something to push you over the edge.\nOn Thursday, 6th February, the morning after sparring in Mulhuddart, where I left off last week, I woke with a cut above my left eye. It was swollen and bruised. I had an uneasy, swimming-like feeling in my head. A spar in Santry was planned that evening, but I decided to avoid contact to protect the cut and told my coach that I’d train at the club. I arrived early for a light ladder warm-up to check how I felt. After only a few minutes, I felt dizzy and off balance. I cut the session short and went home to rest. I was disappointed not to train, but it felt like the right call.\nThe symptoms lingered on Friday, so I skipped the gym. By Saturday, I felt drained. Even walking up stairs left me breathless, and my legs felt like sandbags. Cold and flu symptoms kicked in, too. I told myself I was lucky this was falling over a weekend. If I gave it a day or two, I’d be fine by Monday, ready to go again.\nOn Monday, my black eye was fresh and yellow. When the fogginess and fatigue persisted, I continued to rest rather than train. On Tuesday, it had been five days, and I decided to get a check-up. Later that day, I was in a taxi on the way to Beaumont Hospital for a CT scan. I was talking to this older driver, and he asked about the black eye, so I shared why I was going to the hospital.\nThe driver said, “Hey kid, if the doctor tells you to give up boxing, do it. Mind yourself. Think about your future.” It fed straight into my fears. For a moment, I believed I might be told to quit within the hour.\nWhat surprised me was how my body reacted. The thought brought a wave of relief, like a burden lifted. But almost immediately, I felt guilty. I’d said I was fully committed, yet part of me was looking for a way out.\nThat shocked me more than anything. I realised how much pressure I’d been carrying. But relief is just a feeling. I didn’t need to act on it. The rest of the way, I chose to sit with the uncertainty rather than jump to conclusions.\nAfter waiting six hours, the doctor explained I had no visible damage. I’d experienced mild head trauma, and she recommended I return to training gradually and avoid contact for three weeks.\nI gave myself the rest of the week before returning to training.\nOn Sunday, 16th February, I met a friend for coffee and shared doubts about Porto. The fire inside felt dimmed, and the hospital trip still weighed on me. But my friend encouraged me not to waste the opportunity. It grounded me—reminded me why I started.\nOn Monday, 17th February, I returned to training. I felt behind, like time was slipping away. It wasn’t just the concussion, it was the sense that things outside my control had derailed me. I wanted to take that control back.\nI began mental visualisation to improve consistency under pressure. If your mood dictates your performance, your results will always be unreliable. This practice helped me focus on what I could control.\nMy routine lasted ten minutes: two minutes of grounding using box breathing and bilateral tapping to release tension; six minutes of mental rehearsal, visualising the ring walk, fight scenarios, and final decision; and two minutes of mantra.\nFor the mantra, I focused on three traits: playful, snappy, and relentless. Playful meant loose and fluid footwork —feints, setups, flow. Snappy was about timing and clean execution. Relentless meant staying on the front foot and applying pressure without giving my opponent time to reset.\nTo anchor these traits, I used images, similar to Ali’s “float like a butterfly, sting like a bee”: a monkey for looseness and curiosity, a snake for sharpness and balance, and a train for forward momentum and power. This created the phrase: playful like a monkey, snappy like a snake, and relentless like a train.\nOn Wednesday before training, I ran through a mental visualisation that turned out to be surprisingly effective. I pictured myself walking into the ring, senses heightened, and heart racing. I moved around, took up space, and felt the usual surge of adrenaline and fear. But I stayed with it. As I recited the mantra in the final minutes, a calm focus set in. The visualisation felt like a sandstorm; chaotic at first, energy swirling in every direction. But as I shifted to breathing, the sand began to settle. What had been foggy cleared, and I felt sharp, steady, and back in control.\nOne week later, on Wednesday, 26th February, three weeks had passed, and I was cleared to spar again. In sparring, while I started slow and stuck in my head, I returned to my mantra. My head movement sharpened, and I became lighter on my feet and more present.\nIt wasn’t a standout round, but it felt like a turning point. I was back on track.\nWhat I didn’t realise was that another challenge was just around the corner. Next week, the Dublin Novices Boxing Competition enters the picture."

    "text": "With two unanimous wins under my belt, including my first TKO, I felt confident for the final. But the poor recovery after late night fights was catching up.\nIn The Dark Knight Rises, there is a pivotal scene when Bruce Wayne climbs out of the pit he’s trapped in. I’ve discussed it before in my post “Can you trust ChatGPT?”. He is told by an older inmate\n\nYou do not fear death. You think this makes you strong? It makes you weak.\n\nHe asks Bruce\n\nHow can you move faster than possible? Fight longer than possible? Without the most powerful impulse of the spirit – the fear of death.\n\nand finally advices Bruce to fully commit to the climb by taking a risk and then\n\nfear will find you again.\n\nThe idea always stuck with me. Athletes at the top speak about it often. Those who know how to work with fear can elevate their performance. Those who don’t, crumble under pressure.\nSo in each fight, I tried to identify what fear was active — and work with it.\n\nIn the quarter-final, I feared my preparation wouldn’t show on the night.\nIn the semi, I feared the unknown — I hadn’t seen my opponent before.\nIn the final, I feared complacency, that early success might lose my edge. He was the guy I sparred my twice at Mulhuddart\n\nI used Saturday’s recovery session to correct mistakes I’d been making — overextending and neglecting head movement. My body felt strained, especially in my elbow and wrist. That pain lingered into Monday’s training, where I arrived late and didn’t fully warm up. I needed to prioritise sleep and mobility. By Tuesday, I had a croaky voice and a tingle in my throat. I rested, hoping it would pass but it didn’t.\nMy throat was severely inflamed the following morning. I stayed in bed, avoided screens, and took whatever meds I had. I woke up with a flu on Thursday with congestion, chills, aches, and fatigue. I threw everything at it — ibuprofen, sprays, syrup, sinus clearing, teas, and lozenges – but progress was slow.\nResting during such a crucial period was unsettling. If I couldn’t train, I needed some control. I settled on three priorities: get better first, then fuel for Monday’s final, and finally, make weight for the following Friday’s quarter-final in Porto.\nBut the boredom crept in. Comfort eating became a temptation, but I looked for other outlets. Instead, I practiced sketching random things and listened to Slow Radio – a low-stimulation soundscape podcast that helped pass the time.\nAfter a brief burst of energy Thursday evening, I considered training. I’m glad I didn’t because I was wose again on Friday morning.\nA video call with the GP described it as post-viral fatigue. She advised skipping Monday’s fight and saving myself for Porto. That made sense. I’d already gained experience and confidence from the tournament.\nBut part of me was dead set on fighting. Skipping Monday felt like a half measure. I didn’t want to coast into Porto. I wanted to push through.\nMy older brother offered his perspective when I called him on Saturday. “Don’t rule out Monday yet.” He said the worst had likely passed and fighting Monday could help clear out the cobwebs before Porto. He’d been through something similar. If I was still sick Monday, cancelling was always an option. I ended the call feeling hopeful and optimistic.\nI woke up sharper on Sunday. Still congested with a cough but mentally fresher. I began carb loading. I was preparing for success. I ran through another visualisation focusing on correcting those mistakes.\nThe nerves hit hard on Monday. I felt jittery and my heart raced with a loud, intense energy. I tried box breathing to relax but all it did was perturb what was inside. I just had to accept and sit with it.\nOnce I arrived at the stadium, I found space and warmed up with James, a clubmate fighting in the 80kg semi-final before me.\nThe headphones created a protective bubble. I felt light and snappy, like a whip.\nMy nose was still congested, but I blew it once and forgot about it. In pad work, my wrist flared up again. I reminded myself to focus on the task at hand, and the pain faded.\nWhile waiting in the tunnel, I saw James — he’d won and was through to the final. Walking out to the ring, I was pleasantly surprised to see my family in the crowd: uncles, aunties, cousins, all cheering. I smiled on the inside as I walked up the steps, rolled under the ropes, and shuffled across the ring.\nThe referee called us to the centre. We faced off – my opponent was bigger. As we touched gloves, there was a nod acknowledging our previous two spars. Before the bell, I tapped the corner, reminding myself.\nPlayful. Snappy. Relentless.\nThe opening moments of round 1 were balanced, getting each other’s measure. I stayed on the front foot while he circled and looked to snipe with fast jab. I used my lead hand to probe, then break his rhythm with a backhand to the body or head.\nEarly on, he repeatedly stepped on my lead foot to break my momentum as I inched forward. But the referee caught on quickly and gave him a warning.\nAs the round progress, I pushed him back more consistently. His lateral movement slowed giving me clearer openings. I caught him with several shots toward the end of the round and closed strong.\nIn the corner, the message was simple: continue as I’m going. Keep the head movement, punch with him, and go underneath to the body.\nDespite success in the first, I started round 2 hesitant. I was neither in nor out of range. He wasn’t under pressure but I was open to being attacked. He capitalised on that space, stepping in with sharp shots and pivoting out before I could counter. There were moments where I pressed him on the ropes and landed cleanly, but I wasn’t sustaining the pressure.\nMidway through the round, he threw a double jab and a rear hook to the body. I blocked each shot and countered with a backhand. But in another moment, I hesitated while throwing a shot and he caught me clean with a double 1-2.\nI knew I had let him back into the fight. This was a swing round. The third had to be clear and decisive.\nI started round 3 with urgency – pressing him early, cutting off space. I landed a clean combination: jab head, backhand body, hook over the top, pushing him to the ropes.\nAs the round progressed, we traded on the inside. His shots were quick but easier to read. I slipped and rolled under his 1-2s, countering with backhands before moving inside, layering in second-phase attacks. After landing, I’d smother the exchange, then shift around to his outside allowing me to land before he had reset. I kept up that rhythm through to the end of the round.\nAs the bell rang, I felt confident I’d done enough, particularly in the first and third rounds. When my hand was raised by unanimous decision, I became the Dublin Novice Champion at 67kg.\nAs I exited the ring, I was surrounded by my clubmates and family. Of course, there were some mandatory photos taken, we couldn’t help ourselves! But it felt great to share the moment with everyone.\nBack at the house, I faced the usual sleeplessness — by now, I’d accepted it.\nI felt relief that I’d performed more than anything. The win was satisfying, but I reminded myself this was a stepping stone. The goal was Porto.\nThree days later, I’d be flying out. Thirteen weeks of work complete. Three unanimous wins. The momentum was there.\nJoin me next week when I put it all on the line."
