Welcome to The Tenacious Life! I'm Diarmuid Brady, a curious and passionate data scientist. I believe a tenacious life involves pursuing ambitious goals with determination and action. Through my blog, I hope to inspire people to achieve their goals through relatable, practical, and engaging content centred around my curiosity.


My curiosity drives me to learn, build and teach things from a diverse range of topics including data science, self-development, and film to name a few. I'm interested in connecting with other tenacious and curious people. Please feel free to reach out with any thoughts, suggestions, or advice you might have.
