Welcome to The Tenacious Life! I'm Diarmuid Brady, a curious and passionate data scientist. I believe a tenacious life involves pursuing ambitious goals with action, determination and courage. Through my blog, I hope to inspire people to achieve their goals through relatable, practical, and engaging content centred around my curiosity.


My curiosity drives me to learn, build and teach things from a diverse range of topics including data science and self-development. I'm interested in connecting with other tenacious and curious people so I'd be happy to hear your thoughts, suggestions, or advice you might have.
