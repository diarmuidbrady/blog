<p>Over my time in boxing, I’ve had to cut weight eight times—some for carded fights, others for exhibitions. I’d group those cuts into four types: Long (&gt;5 weeks), Medium (2–5 weeks), Short (&lt;2 weeks), and Maintenance (2 weeks after another weigh-in).</p>
<p>The long cuts – my first time dropping down to 69kg and 67kg – were the most painful. I was inexperienced, made mistakes, built fragile plans that collapsed under pressure. Medium cuts were smoother but still rough, especially when I had to drop weight rapidly near the end. I noticed a predictable rhythm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Week 1 – this feels good</li>
<li>Week 2 – this is a good idea</li>
<li>Week 3 – this might not be a good idea</li>
<li>Week 4 – I’m drained</li>
<li>Week 5+ – get me out of this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Short cuts came with short notice fights and went something like this:</p>
<p>“Diarmuid, there’s a fight on the following weekend, are you up for it?” “Sounds good, is there a weigh-in?” “There is.”</p>
<p>Maintenance cuts felt like limbo – staying down rather than getting down. If the previous cut went well, it was peaceful. If not, it just prolonged the suffering.</p>
<p>Across every type of cut, the core tactics were the same: - Water loading which involved ramping up to 6–8 litres 7 days before weigh-in and tapering down to 0.5L the day before. - Reducing carbs, fibre, and salt—3–4 days out to drop 1–2kg of water weight.</p>
<p>After attending the nutrition talk in January, I realised I was underfuelling. I used to rely on eating filling foods like fruit, veg, and protein. But carbs are the fuel I needed for training and when timed right before and after training, I can eat what I need when I need it with minimal effect on weight. So I can fuel my sessions and still lose weight.</p>
<p>Along with underfuelling came restrictive eating.</p>
<p>During my longer cuts, I thought the only way to stay within my calorie limit was to cut out foods I enjoyed like chocolate entirely. That mindset made the system fragile. I’d be underfuelled before and after training, tightly controlling everything I ate. Any deviation felt like failure.</p>
<p>Inevitably, the pressure would build and the pendulum swung the other way</p>
<p>A small step of relief would sometimes spiral. I’d scroll through Instagram food accounts thinking it would help with cravings. It didn’t. If anything, it just stirred up temptation and frustration.</p>
<p>Over time, I’ve realised restriction is more psychological than nutritional. It’s tied to how comfortable you are with making mistakes. Even a flexible plan can become restrictive if your mindset is rigid.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve created more balance, I still slip up – parties or weekends away – but the impact is smaller and the rebound is quicker. Practicing mindful eating has been helpful for enjoy the foods I like each day in moderation and for understanding what type of food leads to satisfaction or spikes cravings.</p>
<p>Large sharing bars with chewy or crunchy bits tend to trigger a pursuit-driven loop where you’re always chasing the next bit. There are no natural stop points. Small milk chocolate bars, on the other hand, are individually wrapped and portioned. Each piece can melt in the mouth. It slows everything down and leaves me satisfied.</p>
<p>Across this training camp, I noticed a shift in my perspective, I fuelled each training session leading to a higher performance and while weight didn’t go right, it was a step in the right direction. It’s much easier to execute a strategy when you’re comfortable with a margin of error. So when I was 7 days out with 4kg to drop, I didn’t panic. It was unfortunate that I was in this situation but it wasn’t the end of the world, I had a plan and I knew I could execute it.</p>
<p>On Sunday 16th March, I increased my water intake up to 6 litres. Monday was Paddy’s day, so I did my own session. On Tuesday, I began experience the symptoms of the weight cut, I noticed an impatience with not getting work complete and greater self-consciousness around interactions with people. When these thought, I observe at a distance. Otherwise, they’d eat me alive!</p>
<p>Leaving work on Wednesday, I felt the very unpleasant sensation of raw anxiety in the body and it’s often accompanied by a shortness of breath, unease, and tension. It’s like an internal alarm system saying something bad is happening or is going to happen. Be on alert.</p>
<p>I felt to pressure to perform in training that evening since I had such an electric performance the previous week. I expected myself to maintain it but I was concerned that the weight cut would affect my performance even though I still fuelled the session.</p>
<p>Training began well as I was sharp in my shadowboxing and school sparring. As I moved into open sparring, I focused on picking my shots. But after the first round, it was suggested to up the intensity. In the heat of spar, my partner found a rhythm and landed three clean backhands on my nose. It began bleeding, it flowing like a river, and it wasn’t stopping. I stepped out and cleaned it up but when I got back it, it opened up again and I had to end the spar. I felt humiliated and embarrassed.</p>
<p>The last time my nose got busted that badly was a year ago less than a week before my fight in Porto. I was at an external spar and nose was bloody. This led to my nose reopening during my fight in Porto and in the third round, the fight was close to being stopped by the end because of the bleeding.</p>
<p>Now it had happened again, and more intense emotions began rising. At this point, I realised I needed some space to calm down and cool off so I went out to the adjacent training hall to do some skipping and stretching by myself quietly.</p>
<p>During the cool down, my thoughts began spiralling. In my mind, I was pointing the finger at everyone, including myself. I felt I should have learned from last year. It was less than a week out from a fight and I felt a lot anger inside. But beneath the anger was sadness and fear. I was upset it had happened and scared that it affected my chances next week.</p>
<p>When I got home, it dawned on me that the blame I held on to was just a way of avoiding the emotions. I chose to spar and that comes with a risk. But I had put too much weight on this one spar, it wasn’t ideal but it didn’t determined next week. I can still perform.</p>
<p>On Thursday, I was 3 days out and I began reducing carbs, fibre, and salt as well as my water intake. In training that evening, I didn’t spar since I was low on energy.</p>
<p>My energy had lowered by Saturday significantly as I began fasting from midday and reduced my water to 0.5 litres. By Saturday evening, I was 70kg and I made a plan based on how much I had to lose the following morning.</p>
<p>Sunday morning, I woke up at 68.7kg - down 1.3kg overnight. I had 1.7kg to lose so I aimed for 2kg to be sure. I prepared a sweat session that focused on sustained moderate intensity of a duration of time.</p>
<p>I did 6 rounds of 12 minutes each:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 minutes steady skipping</li>
<li>3 minutes shadowboxing</li>
<li>3 minutes jogging in place with high knees</li>
<li>30 seconds squats</li>
<li>30 seconds pushups</li>
<li>1 minute jumping jacks</li>
<li>1 minute arm circles</li>
</ul>
<p>Between rounds, I took 3-minute breaks. Halfway, I took a 15-minute break lying on the bed in full sweat gear, wrapped in 2 blankets and a towel. After round 6, I took a 30-minute break in the same setup. Each break I took allowed my body to sweat during that time.</p>
<p>I was covered head to toe in gear including a full body lycra base, joggers, thermal socks, shoes, long sleeve gym top, half-zip, waterproof jacket with gloves, a scarf, and a hat</p>
<p>It was uncomfortable, but manageable. Cutting this much water in a short time carries risk, so I watched for any dizziness or light-headedness. Luckily, I felt a clear focus the whole way through. I just had to stick to the plan. And I did.</p>
<p>I went down to the weigh-in. I ended up dropping 2.2kg and weighed in at 66.5kg –&nbsp;0.5kg under. There were six of us from the club there. While waiting, I looked around to see who else was competing. I recognised some guys I’d sparred against from other clubs. But someone caught my eye—a guy I’d watched in the National Intervarsities Senior Novice Final at 67kg. I sized him up. He carried a lot of upper-body muscle, but it didn’t bother me. He was a southpaw like me and I wondered if we would be in the same weight class.</p>
<p>Straight after the weigh-in, I drank a little water and a Dioralyte. I ate a rice pudding slowly to ease back into food. Across the day, I ate meals gradually across the day to avoid overloading the body. They focused on carbohydrates because it was time to fuel for next week. I felt a lot of relief that it had gone smoothly and I was excited for what was to come.</p>
<p>I’ll see you next week as I going through my pre-fight preparations and a look at my quarter final fight.</p>
