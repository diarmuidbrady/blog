<p>Over my time in boxing, I’ve had to cut weight 8 times for both official carded and exhibition fights. I’d categorise my weight cuts into 4 types. Long (&gt;5 weeks), medium (2-5 weeks), short (&lt; 2 weeks), and maintenance (within 2 weeks of a previous weight cut).</p>
<p>The long cuts were the first time I dropped down to 69kg and 67kg. These were the worst, mostly because I was inexperienced and I made many mistakes. Medium cuts were short enough not to drag out but were long enough to be smoother but each time I had to drop a chunk of weight in the week leading into the fight affected performance. During these medium and long cuts, I noticed a week by week pattern. Week 1, I’m just starting and I’m feeling good. Week 2, I think god this is such a great idea, why haven’t I done this before. Week 3, oh god this might not be such a good idea. Week 4, Wow, I feel drained, a lot. And after Week 5 - okay I can’t take this any longer, this is just torture.”</p>
<p>Short cuts are when I’m asked “Diarmuid, there’s a fight/show on the following weekend, are you up for it?” – “Ah yeh, sounds good, is there a weigh-in?” &nbsp;– “There is but don’t worry about it too much.” but inevitably I cut whatever I could because the alternative is fighting against bigger opponent, not what I want. It’s short and intense meaning that it doesn’t drag out but it can have an impact on performance.</p>
<p>Maintenance feels a bit like limbo, I’m not trying to get down, I’m trying to stay down. If I’ve finished a hard weight cut, it feels like it just drags out an already unpleasant experience but if the cut went smoothly then, it can be peaceful, the pressure is removed since I’m in a good place (body and mind), giving me more headspace to focus on my fight prep.</p>
<p>The main tactics of a cut usually come in the final 7-10 days, I begin by increasing water up to 6-8 litres and then reduce it steadily down to 0.5 litres the day before. Around 3-4 days out, I reduce carbs, fibre, and salt which removes about 1-2kg water weight.</p>
<p>Eating filling foods like fruit, veg, and protein becomes very important for satiety but they never saved me from underfuelling training sessions. This is the key mistake I made and it stood out when I attended the nutrition talk back in January. Carbohydrates are the key ingredient when fuelling a session and when timed right – within the 6 hour window before training and the 2 hour window after – I can consume what I need when I need it with minimal effect on weight. So you can fuel your sessions and still lose weight.</p>
<p>So if underfuelling is the first mistake, then restrictive eating is the notorious second.</p>
<p>During those long cuts, I thought I needed to cut out chocolate entirely because I didn’t have space with the limited calories I was consuming. I’d created a fragile system where I was underfuelled before and after training while also over-restricting on eating chocolate and things I enjoy. Any small deviation felt like failure. Inevitably, the pressure builds and over those longer cuts, the pendulum swung the other, resulting in evenings where a small step of relief turned into a landslide. On top of that, during my first weight cut, I’d scroll through instagram my bakeries, cafes, etc. thinking this misguided, silly strategy would provide some relief but it only added fuel to the fire creating this concoction of temptation and frustration.</p>
<p>I’ve come to understand restriction as more of a state of mind tied to how comfortable I am with making mistakes and a need to control the small, inconsequential details. Even if a plan incorporates ‘flexibility’, a rigid, restrictive mind will boil it down to set of commandments that must be followed to the tee.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve learned to create more balance, though I do slip up here and there like the work party or the trip away but it’s often to a lesser degree having less impact and making it easier to get back on track. I like to practice mindful eating by eating the foods I enjoy each day in moderation and understanding what type of chocolate leads to satisfaction and what leads to wanting more.</p>
<p>For example, a massive sharing bar that includes either crunchy or chewy bits often leaves me unsatisfied while I’m always relaxed after one bar of the small (30g) individually wrapped kinder milk chocolates. I was very curious about this because clearly there was something psychologically that consistently led me to the same pattern of feeling.</p>
<p>What I deduced was that the large sharing bar has no natural stop points, when breaking off a piece, it’s very easy to just break off another but the kinder bars do, since they are individually wrapped. A second note is that crunchy or chewy food leads to this pursuit-driven loop where the focus isn’t on the current bite but on the next while I usually let the kinder milk chocolate melt leading to a sort of slow satisfying sensation. I’m fascinated by how all of those features can affect your perception and behaviour.</p>
<p>Across this training camp, I noticed a shift in my perspective, I fuelled each training session leading to a higher performance and while weight didn’t go right, it was a step in the right direction. It’s much easier to execute a strategy when you’re comfortable with a margin of error. So when I was 7 days out with 4kg to drop, I didn’t panic. It was unfortunate that I was in this situation but it wasn’t the end of the world, I had a plan and I knew I could execute it.</p>
<p>On Sunday 16th March, I increased my water intake up to 6 litres. Monday was Paddy’s day, so I did my own session. On Tuesday, I began experience the symptoms of the weight cut, I noticed an impatience with not getting work complete and greater self-consciousness around interactions with people. When these thought, I observe at a distance. Otherwise, they’d eat me alive!</p>
<p>Leaving work on Wednesday, I felt the very unpleasant sensation of raw anxiety in the body and it’s often accompanied by a shortness of breath, unease, and tension. It’s like an internal alarm system saying something bad is happening or is going to happen. Be on alert.</p>
<p>I felt to pressure to perform in training that evening since I had such an electric performance the previous week. I expected myself to maintain it but I was concerned that the weight cut would affect my performance even though I still fuelled the session.</p>
<p>Training began well as I was sharp in my shadowboxing and school sparring. As I moved into open sparring, I focused on picking my shots. But after the first round, it was suggested to up the intensity. In the heat of spar, my partner found a rhythm and landed three clean backhands on my nose. It began bleeding, it flowing like a river, and it wasn’t stopping. I stepped out and cleaned it up but when I got back it, it opened up again and I had to end the spar. I felt humiliated and embarrassed.</p>
<p>The last time my nose got busted that badly was a year ago less than a week before my fight in Porto. I was at an external spar and nose was bloody. This led to my nose reopening during my fight in Porto and in the third round, the fight was close to being stopped by the end because of the bleeding.</p>
<p>Now it had happened again, and more intense emotions began rising. At this point, I realised I needed some space to calm down and cool off so I went out to the adjacent training hall to do some skipping and stretching by myself quietly.</p>
<p>During the cool down, my thoughts began spiralling. In my mind, I was pointing the finger at everyone, including myself. I felt I should have learned from last year. It was less than a week out from a fight and I felt a lot anger inside. But beneath the anger was sadness and fear. I was upset it had happened and scared that it affected my chances next week.</p>
<p>When I got home, it dawned on me that the blame I held on to was just a way of avoiding the emotions. I chose to spar and that comes with a risk. But I had put too much weight on this one spar, it wasn’t ideal but it didn’t determined next week. I can still perform.</p>
<p>On Thursday, I was 3 days out and I began reducing carbs, fibre, and salt as well as my water intake. In training that evening, I didn’t spar since I was low on energy.</p>
<p>My energy had lowered by Saturday significantly as I began fasting from midday and reduced my water to 0.5 litres. By Saturday evening, I was 70kg and I made a plan based on how much I had to lose the following morning.</p>
<p>Sunday morning, I woke up at 68.7kg - down 1.3kg overnight. I had 1.7kg to lose so I aimed for 2kg to be sure. I prepared a sweat session that focused on sustained moderate intensity of a duration of time.</p>
<p>I did 6 rounds of 12 minutes each:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 minutes steady skipping</li>
<li>3 minutes shadowboxing</li>
<li>3 minutes jogging in place with high knees</li>
<li>30 seconds squats</li>
<li>30 seconds pushups</li>
<li>1 minute jumping jacks</li>
<li>1 minute arm circles</li>
</ul>
<p>Between rounds, I took 3-minute breaks. Halfway, I took a 15-minute break lying on the bed in full sweat gear, wrapped in 2 blankets and a towel. After round 6, I took a 30-minute break in the same setup. Each break I took allowed my body to sweat during that time.</p>
<p>I was covered head to toe in gear including a full body lycra base, joggers, thermal socks, shoes, long sleeve gym top, half-zip, waterproof jacket with gloves, a scarf, and a hat</p>
<p>It was uncomfortable, but manageable. Cutting this much water in a short time carries risk, so I watched for any dizziness or light-headedness. Luckily, I felt a clear focus the whole way through. I just had to stick to the plan. And I did.</p>
<p>I went down to the weigh-in. I ended up dropping 2.2kg and weighed in at 66.5kg –&nbsp;0.5kg under. There were six of us from the club there. While waiting, I looked around to see who else was competing. I recognised some guys I’d sparred against from other clubs. But someone caught my eye—a guy I’d watched in the National Intervarsities Senior Novice Final at 67kg. I sized him up. He carried a lot of upper-body muscle, but it didn’t bother me. He was a southpaw like me and I wondered if we would be in the same weight class.</p>
<p>Straight after the weigh-in, I drank a little water and a Dioralyte. I ate a rice pudding slowly to ease back into food. Across the day, I ate meals gradually across the day to avoid overloading the body. They focused on carbohydrates because it was time to fuel for next week. I felt a lot of relief that it had gone smoothly and I was excited for what was to come.</p>
<p>I’ll see you next week as I going through my pre-fight preparations and a look at my quarter final fight.</p>
