<p>On Monday at 11am, I found out I was fighting Tuesday night. The news hit with a mix of nerves and eagerness — just over 30 hours to shift from routine into fight mode.</p>
<p>I already knew my opponent. I’d watched him in the Intervarsity Finals at 67kg. A Southpaw — fast, aggressive, and confident, maybe even cocky. I believed I had more power and planned to break him down under pressure.</p>
<p>That day, I visualised what I wanted to do — move my head, cut off the ring, close the distance. I pictured arriving at the venue, walking to the blue corner, stepping up to the ring — left, right, left, right, left — and performing my ring ritual.</p>
<p>I trained that evening, drilling southpaw-specific distance work, lead hand control, and tailored combinations. Sparring experience earlier in camp had made the stance feel familiar.</p>
<p>At home, I topped up carbs and ran through a negative visualisation: making mistakes, adapting in real time, and staying composed under pressure.</p>
<p>I woke up Tuesday feeling under slept, only got to bed around midnight. My body felt achy with a little mental tiredness lingering. Breakfast included porridge, yogurt, banana, and berries to load up on carbs.</p>
<p>During work, I felt strangely cold despite everyone being in t-shirts. But I put on a jacket and thought no more of it. I took a half day at lunch, ate some pasta and chicken before walking home in the sunshine listening to Roy Ayers Ubiquity, Frank Ocean, and Jungle.</p>
<p>When I got home, I performed a full mental visualisation: arriving at the venue, settling in, warming up, walking out, and going through my ring ritual. I recalled a clip I’d watched of Ethan Hawke giving advice to a young actor: “Preparation, preparation, preparation…let go”. After visualisation I let go too, my preparation was complete. I’d done all the work. Now it was time to relax, enjoy the moment, and let the evening unfold. I felt the weight drop from my shoulders.</p>
<p>At home, I ran a full mental visualisation — arriving, warming up, walking out, and going through my ring ritual. I remembered a clip of Ethan Hawke’s advice on performance: <em>“Preparation, preparation, preparation… let go.”</em> And I did. All the work was done and I felt the weight drop from my shoulders.</p>
<p>I took a 20-minute nap, then showered to freshen up, packing my bag while listening to summer music: Empire of the Sun, Macklemore, Mac Miller. I ate rice pudding and a banana around 5 while watching Mad Men and called my parents for a chat.</p>
<p>At 7, I met my clubmates and headed to the venue. I watched one or two fights, then performed my final visualisation – the whole fight, start to finish. My transition into the zone. With my headphones on, I disappeared into my own world, listening to Irish rock classics: Thin Lizzy, U2, The Cranberries.</p>
<p>I took a small 1x2 metre space in the corner of the packed dressing room, warming up while facing a mirror. With two fights to go, my coach brought me out for pads. Nothing existed except the task in front of me: get in the ring, fight, and win.</p>
<p>As I walked out to the blue corner, it all felt familiar — the crowd, the noise, and the nerves. I stepped up into the ring — left, right, left, right, left — and moved through the ropes, gliding across the ring and back. We approached the centre. I looked my opponent in the eye. He looked confident, but I was unfazed, I was ready. We tapped gloves and eased back to our corners.</p>
<p>Moments before the bell, I tapped the corner three times.</p>
<p><strong>Playful. Snappy. Relentless.</strong></p>
<p>I started <strong>round one</strong> static and reserved, getting the measure of my opponent. He managed distance by catching me with straight jabs.</p>
<p>Ninety seconds in, my nose began bleeding, the fight paused, and the doctor cleaned it up. I reminded myself, it’s only the first round, just move my head and loosen up.</p>
<p>In the next exchange, he threw a one-two. I slipped right, landed a lead hook to the body, followed by a straight cross. I remembered the look in his eye, he had felt it.</p>
<p>In the corner, my coach reminded me to move my head and work specific combinations.</p>
<p>In <strong>round two</strong>, I applied pressure, but still got caught. Midway through the round, he slowed. I cornered him and landed the same combination — slip right, lead hook to the body, straight down the middle — followed by a second cross that threw his head back. The ref stepped in and called for a 10 count, my opponent leaning across the ropes. The bell rang soon after.</p>
<p>Back in the corner, I felt in more control, but the fight was still up for grabs. I knew I had to push it home in the third.</p>
<p>The fight came down to the <strong>final round</strong>. After I landed a few hard shots, the ref paused the fight, now my opponent bleeding and to get checked. Throughout the round, we exchanged repeatedly, but I landed the cleaner, more visible shots.</p>
<p>At the final bell, I returned to my corner confident. I shook the hands of my opponent and his coach, and stood beside the referee. My arm was raised. I’d won by unanimous decision. I felt a thrill as I met my brothers and clubmates who came to support me.</p>
<p>Back home, the buzz of the adrenaline lingered, it felt like drinking 5 expresso shots. As my mind buzz, I didn’t sleep until 2am. Another poor night of sleep.</p>
<p>I woke up the next morning, shook off the tiredness with the confident I felt inside. At training, my concentration was lower. As I worked on the inside pad work with my coach, I messed up the combinations and became frustrated. Thankfully, coach encouraged me to keep at it which grounded me. Eventually I got into a groove, and ended the session strongly.</p>
<p>Before bed, my mind was exhausted but still had to plan out my meals for Thursday with my semi-final Friday. My thought were disorganised and it took forever to cook and prep meals, and clean up after. Weight management was still on my mind as I was back up to 71. But I reassured myself it was natural. Focus on winning my fights now, worry about weight later. Once again, I didn’t get to sleep until around midnight.</p>
<p>On Thursday, I began reflecting on Tuesday’s fight. The feeling I had stepping into the ring was seamless. I felt like I was already there before it began. From the moment I performed my mental visualisation, I entered the zone. Visualising my arrival at the venue helped set the tone, and the music in my headphones deepened that state as I warmed up. In the dressing room, I felt undeterrable. As I moved, I dropped deeper into a flow. I felt fluid and focused, and in the tunnel before the fight, I was completely present. The crowd noise faded—not because I blocked it, but because focus quieted everything. I was calm and alert. When I reached the ring, there was no jolt of realisation or shock like in previous fights. I was already there.</p>
<p>I also thought about my fight on Friday. I’d gotten a lot of praise from Tuesday’s win, but I didn’t want to feel like I’d accomplished anything yet. This was just experience leading into Porto. My first task was to win the Dublin Novices, but my main goal was to win the Porto Box Cup. I wanted to re-centre my focus on that.</p>
<p>I knew I needed to improve a few things: allow more time for warm-up and visualisation, get past that first wave of tiredness, and start sharp. My coach said it was possible I’d fight Friday and again on Saturday, so I needed food ready right after the fight to refuel for the next day.</p>
<p>That day, I planned another carb load. I aimed for over 3,000 calories and around 500 grams of carbohydrates, split across breakfast, lunch, an afternoon snack, and dinner.</p>
<p>That evening, I performed another mental visualisation—a negative one. I rehearsed getting hit, reminding myself to move my head and actually doing it. I also focused on my feet. I sometimes lunged in without bringing my back foot. I rehearsed staying balanced and keeping my stance compact under pressure.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, I felt tired, nervous, and drained. My energy was low. But as lunchtime came around, I settled into the same routine as Tuesday. I ate breakfast and lunch, went home to rest listening to chill, feel-good music, and performed my mental visualisation of entering the venue and walking to the ring. I took a 20-minute nap, showered, listened to happy summer music, watched some television, called my parents, and ate my last snack of rice pudding and a banana. I chilled out watching some TV.</p>
<p>Making my way down to the venue, I was by myself, and I felt nervous. I didn’t know who my opponent was, unlike last time, and I could feel the butterflies flutter inside. I walked in, sat down, and performed my last visualisation. With my headphones on, I went inside to warm up, listening to Irish rock classics. I was in the blue corner again. I took up the same 1x2 metre space—it was familiar now. I’d given myself more time for a warm-up, and by the end of it, I felt better than I had the previous fight.</p>
<p>As my bout got closer—two fights to go—my coach brought me out for pad work and I fell into a trance. I felt like I was standing in a quiet room with just myself, my coach, and the ring waiting outside with my opponent in it. My eyes were locked in tunnel vision, and as I moved, I was free of tension. I was ready for war.</p>
<p>I walked out to the ring just like before. On the way out, I noticed my dad facing the ring and as I walked by from behind, I gave him a sneaky tap on the back. I got into the ring, moved to the ropes and back. The ref went through the rules as I looked my opponent in the eye. He was looked more experienced but I felt sharp. As I returned to my corner, I tapped it three times.</p>
<p><strong>Playful. Snappy. Relentless.</strong></p>
<p>In the <strong>first round,</strong> both of us came out light on our feet, showing our jabs. We were boxing toe-to-toe. He had sharper, more fluid movements, and his shots were snappier, but in the opening exchanges I landed some strong shots and had success pushing him back and off balance. I had more strength and used that to disrupt his movement. Since he was more skilled at being evasive, he moved well around me. We were both catching each other with shots, and overall it was a balanced round. But his control in exchanges and his ability to get in, land, and move out put him ahead.</p>
<p>With 30 seconds left, he threw a shot I blocked. I retaliated with a rear hook to the body, which caught him clean and pushed him back to the corner. A shot like that takes time to show its effect. Later in the round, I was a little off balance while he stayed composed. He moved in, got his shots off, and slipped out of range. By the end of the round, I began slowing down. There were moments where I cornered him, but as I threw, he countered and moved around me easily. It was clear his boxing skill was higher than mine.</p>
<p>At the end of the round, my coach said, “Dermot, you’re trying to out-box this fella. If you try and out-box this fella, you’re going to lose. You need to push him back, keep the intensity high, bully him, and break him down.”</p>
<p><strong>Round two</strong> started with the same cat and mouse: me trying to corner him, him trying to move out and around. But this time I was more measured and didn’t jump in too soon. In our first proper exchange, we went toe to toe, and I caught him a few times before he moved off. Then, in another exchange, I landed backhands and had success on the inside.</p>
<p>Halfway through the round, I had him in a corner. I landed enough shots to keep him there, and he was struggling to get out. Eventually, he escaped, but as he moved to the other side of the ring, I chased him with jabs and didn’t let him out of my sight. As I pushed him against the ropes, I threw one-twos, followed by a hook-cross that raised his guard, exposing his body. I capitalised with a powerful lead hook downstairs.</p>
<p>The ref stepped in and called a 10-count. What happened next surprised me. He went back to his corner, dropped to his hunkers, and shook his head. He was struggling. The ref counted, but he wasn’t getting up. Eventually, the ref waved the fight off. I’d won.</p>
<p>It was my first ever stoppage. I was shocked and proud. I’d outworked him. In the words of David Goggins, I’d taken his soul. I’d pushed him, and he just couldn’t go on. Back in my corner, I high-fived my coach. He looked at me and said, “Do I tell lies, do I?” I laughed. He told me to bully him, push him back, and disrupt his rhythm—and it worked.</p>
<p>Afterwards, my clubmates and my dad were there to congratulate me. The feeling was euphoric. We stayed to watch my teammate David fight next. He lost against an opponent supposedly well above the novice category—someone who claimed to be Conor McGregor’s sparring partner.</p>
<p>Later that evening, I found out that the final wouldn’t be the next day—it was pushed out to Monday, the 7th of April, four days before my quarter-final fight in Porto. It wasn’t ideal, but I had to get on with it.</p>
<p>When I went to lie down, rest was the last thing on my mind. My brain started planning—scheming—trying to figure out how to handle the next week and a half. Managing my weight, refueling, training—my thoughts were jumping around. After my quarter-final win, I’d felt like I’d had five coffees. Now it felt like fifty.</p>
<p>I used every technique I could: meditation, a walk, a cold shower, splashing water on my face, light exercise—but my mind wouldn’t settle. I eventually got to bed at 3 a.m., ending a week full of energy output and poor recovery.</p>
<p>I had one week to go until my final. One more after that until Porto was over. I’d already asked a lot of my body. Now I just needed it to give me a little bit more.</p>
<p>Next week, we’ll see how my body responded to the break before the final and how the Dublin Novices turned out in the end.</p>
