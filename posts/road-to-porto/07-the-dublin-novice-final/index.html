<p>With two unanimous wins under my belt, including my first TKO, I felt confident for the final. But the poor recovery after late night fights were catching up.</p>
<p>A favourite film scene of mine is from <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> when Bruce Wayne makes the climb to the top of the pit he’s trapped in. I’ve discussed it before in my post <a href="https://thetenaciouslife.com/posts/chatgpt-evaluation/chatgpt-p1/">Can you trust ChatGPT?</a> He is told by an old inmate</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You do not fear death. You think this makes you strong? It makes you weak.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He asks him</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>How can you move faster than possible? Fight longer than possible? Without the most powerful impulse of the spirit – the fear of death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and finally advices Bruce to fully commit to the climb by taking a risk and then</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>fear will find you again.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea always stuck with me. Athletes at the top speak about it often. Those who know how to work with fear can elevate their performance. Those who don’t, crumble under pressure.</p>
<p>So in each fight, I tried to identify what fear was active — and work with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the quarter-final, it was fear that all my preparation wouldn’t translate on the night.</li>
<li>In the semi, it was fear of the unknown — I hadn’t seen my opponent before.</li>
<li>In the final, it was fear of complacency. I had early success. But I didn’t want to lose my edge.</li>
</ul>
<p>I used Saturday’s recovery session to correct mistakes I’d been making — overextending and neglecting head movement. My body felt strained, especially in my elbow and wrist. That pain lingered into Monday’s training, where I arrived late and didn’t fully warm up – a clear sign I needed to prioritise sleep and mobility. By Tuesday, I had a croaky voice and a tingle in my throat. I rested, hoping it would pass but it didn’t.</p>
<p>My throat was severely inflamed the following morning. I stayed in bed, avoided screens, and took whatever meds I had. By Thursday, I woke up fully sick: congestion, chills, aches, and fatigue. It felt like punishment after a solid 10-hour sleep. I threw everything at it — ibuprofen, sprays, syrup, sinus clearing, teas, and lozenges – but progress was slow.</p>
<p>Resting during such a crucial period was unsettling. If I couldn’t train, I needed some control. I settled on three priorities: get better first, then fuel for Monday’s final, and finally, make weight for the following Friday’s quarter-final in Porto.</p>
<p>But the boredom crept in. Comfort eating became a temptation, but I looked for other outlets. Instead, I practiced sketching random things and listened to <em>Slow Radio –</em> low-stimulation soundscapes that helped pass the time.</p>
<p>After a brief burst of energy Thursday evening, I considered training. I’m glad I didn’t. By Friday morning, it was worse again.</p>
<p>A video call with the GP described it as post-viral fatigue. She advised skipping Monday’s fight and saving myself for Porto. That made sense. I’d already gained experience and confidence from the tournament.</p>
<p>But part of me was dead set on fighting. Skipping Monday felt like a half measure. I didn’t want to coast into Porto. I wanted to push through.</p>
<p>My older brother offered his perspective when I called him on Saturday. “Don’t rule out Monday yet.” He said the worst had likely passed and fighting Monday could help clear out the cobwebs before Porto. He’d been through something similar. If I was still sick Monday, cancelling was always an option. I ended the call feeling hopeful and optimistic.</p>
<p>I woke up sharper on Sunday. Still congested with a cough but mentally fresher. I began carb loading. I was preparing for success. I ran through another visualisation focusing on correcting those mistakes.</p>
<p>The nerves hit hard on Monday. I felt jittery and my heart raced with a loud, intense energy. I tried box breathing to relax but all it did was perturb what was inside. I just had to accept and sit with it.</p>
<p>Once I arrived at the stadium, I found out the dressing rooms were off limits — the youth girls were on before us — so I found space elsewhere and warmed up with James, a clubmate fighting just before me.</p>
<p>The headphones created a protective bubble. I felt light and snappy, like a whip.</p>
<p>My nose was still a little congested. I blew it once or twice after my warm up but once I moved into pad work with two fights to go, I put it out of my mind. As I practiced the combinations on the pads, the pain in my wrist returned. I reminded myself to focus on the task at hand and after a few minutes, it eased or I forgot about it.</p>
<p>While waiting in the tunnel, I saw James, who had won his fight and was through to the final. As I walked to the ring, I was surprised by my family, uncles, aunties, and cousins who were cheering in the crowd. I smiled on the inside as I walked up the steps, rolled under the ropes, and shuffled across the ring.</p>
<p>The referee called us to the centre. We faced off with him being the larger opponent. As we touched gloves, there was a nod acknowledging our previous two spars but I wasn’t there to get all sentimental. Before the bell, I tapped the corner, reminding myself.</p>
<p><strong>Playful. Snappy. Relentless.</strong></p>
<p>The opening moments of <strong>round 1</strong> were balanced, getting each other’s measure. I stayed on the front foot while he circled and looked to snipe with fast, clean shots. I used my jab to probe, then looked to break his rhythm with a backhand to the body or head.</p>
<p>Early on, he repeatedly stepped on my lead foot to break my momentum as I inched forward. But the referee caught on quickly and gave him a warning.</p>
<p>As the round progress, I pushed him back more consistently. His lateral movement slowed giving me clearer openings. I caught him with several shots toward the end of the round and closed strong.</p>
<p>In the corner, the message was simple: continue as I’m going. Keep the head movement, punch with him, and go underneath to the body.</p>
<p>Despite success in the first, I started <strong>round 2</strong> hesitant. I was neither in or out of range, meaning he wasn’t under pressure and I was open to attack. He capitalised on that space, stepping in with sharp shots and pivoting out before I could counter. There were moments where I pressed him on the ropes and landed cleanly, but I wasn’t sustaining the pressure.</p>
<p>Midway through the round, he threw a double jab and a rear hook to the body. I blocked each shot and countered with a backhand. But in another moment, I hesitated while throwing a shot and he caught me clean with a double 1-2.</p>
<p>I knew I had let him back into the fight. This was a swing round. The third had to be clear and decisive.</p>
<p>I started <strong>round three</strong> with urgency – pressing him early, cutting off space. I landed a clean combination: jab head, backhand body, hook over the top, pushing him to the ropes.</p>
<p>As the round progressed, the fight moved closer on the inside. his shots were quick but easier to read. I slipped and rolled under his 1-2s, coiuntering with backhands before moving inside, layering in second-phase attacks. After landing, I’d smother the exchange, then shift around to his outside allowing me to land before he had reset. I kept up that rhythm through to the end of the round.</p>
<p>As the bell rung, I felt confident I’d done enough, particularly in the first and third rounds. When my hand was raised by unanimous decision, I became the Dublin Novice Champion at 67kg.</p>
<p>As I exited the ring, I was surrounded by my clubmates and family. Of course, there were some mandatory photos taken, we couldn’t help ourselves! But it felt great to share the moment with everyone.</p>
<p>Back at the house, I faced the same sleeplessness. At this point, I had accepted it. I felt relieved that I had performed. The win was exciting but I didn’t want to be lured into feeling satisfied. I entered the Dublin Novices for experience, the goal was Porto. I reminded myself that this was a stepping stone – an opportunity to build momentum.</p>
<p>In 3 days, I was flying out to Porto. I finished the 13 week camp. I had 3 unanimous victories. I had all the momentum I needed. Now it was time to put it all on the line.</p>
