<p>The plan was straightforward: train hard for seven weeks, rest for one, and finish with five weeks of sharpening. It didn’t stay simple for long.</p>
<p>I followed a focused but demanding schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mon: Club</li>
<li>Tue: Gym Strength</li>
<li>Wed: Club</li>
<li>Thu: Club</li>
<li>Fri: Gym Explosive</li>
<li>Sat: Rest</li>
<li>Sun: Footwork &amp; Technique</li>
</ul>
<p>At DCU Boxing Club, Derek, Colin, and Terry run the sessions. Between them, they’ve decades of experience, working with all levels, from novices to Olympians. Derek likes to say, “<em>Boxing shows you who you are</em>.” Colin likes to test your limits. And if you ask Terry what he thinks of boxing, he might say, “tough sport”. They’ve a real passion for boxing and are dedicated to helping us develop our skills.</p>
<p>Club sessions followed a familiar pattern – warm up, shadow boxing, technical skills in school sparring, and drilling combinations with (seemingly endless) rounds of bag work. Finally, we put it all together in open sparring. “<em>Finally”</em> you thought? Oh no, do your skipping and core work first, then you’re free to go.</p>
<p>For me, club sessions were a high priority. I aimed to show up well-fuelled, ready to work, and with a positive attitude.</p>
<p>This plan was more intense than I was used to. Managing stress and training load, both inside and outside the gym, became critical. Each week, I’d look ahead at what I had planned and see if I needed to make any adjustments.</p>
<p>I set myself one rule: no more than two hard spars a week. But it was tricky; on good nights, I was eager to get in and on bad ones, I didn’t want to look like I was ducking out.</p>
<p>I logged each session after leaving the gym. I learned early that writing out each session was gruelling, so I switched to ChatGPT voice notes. I’d ramble through each session and ask it to give a breakdown of what worked, what didn’t, and a focus for the next session.</p>
<p>The gym work was simple but deliberate – everything needed to transfer to boxing. Tuesdays were for strength: squats, deadlifts, pull-ups and shoulder press, keeping reps low. Fridays kept the movements but swapped weight for speed, incorporating jumping squats and deadlifts, sternum-to-bar pull-ups, and the landmine press, which I liked, especially for improving foot, hip, and torso coordination.</p>
<p>Sundays were at my own pace. I explored and played with new techniques and footwork, and finished with cardio. Early in camp, I did steady-state, and later on, I’d perform sprints.</p>
<p>After each session, I always stretched for at least 5 minutes. The small habit made a big difference, I felt looser and less sore across the week.</p>
<p>The first few weeks went to plan – six sessions a week, knocking them off one by one. I felt stronger, my skills were sharpening, and I started using mental visualisation during sparring with mixed success. The training load was heavy, but I believed I was managing it.</p>
<p>Things kicked off in week 4 with our first external spar of the year – a chance <em>to blow off the cobwebs</em>. External spars are of a higher intensity. They’re not real fight intensity, but there’s no friendly familiarity. Most gyms ban filming to protect boxers’ privacy. It’s a pity, you can learn a thing or two from watching the spars back. The night before, I did a deload gym session to make sure I was fresh for Cabra. I usually avoid small tweaks, but external spars were a priority.</p>
<p>Wednesday, January 22nd, 19:30, we arrived in Cabra BC. I stepped through the ropes and looked across the ring at a stocky 80+ kg lad, staring me down and ready to rock— <em>Oh Jaysus, here we go</em>. From the get-go, he switched between throwing bombs on the inside (nearly took my head off) and gliding around on the outside.</p>
<p>The second opponent was taller and longer, someone I’d fought before. He had a high work rate, and his shots were clean. I stayed composed, blocked plenty, but it was clear my conditioning needed work.</p>
<p>As I left, I noticed my second opponent still on the bags, practicing combinations. For him, the session wasn’t over yet.</p>
<p>The very next day at the club, I sparred again. Third spar of the week – breaking my rule. Two rounds in, I was sluggish, static, and getting hit far too often. I felt angry at myself over the decision to get in. But after talking with the coach, I realised that while sparring mightn’t have been the best call, you don’t always get the luxury of perfect conditions.</p>
<p>A week later, on Wednesday in Mulhuddart BC, I felt sharper. Two bigger opponents, but both at my weight – one dangerous on the inside, the other slick and elusive on the outside. I controlled distance better, countered cleanly, and spotted openings I’d missed before. I left happy, and my coach was too.</p>
<p>Cherry Orchard BC was a different story. The following evening we were melting getting into the ring. The ceiling heating turned the place into a sauna. I was first in, switching between one southpaw and one orthodox opponent. Each change confused me, and I took too long to adapt. &nbsp;But with the southpaw, when I finally parried his jab and fired mine through, it landed. Afterwards, my coach told me to stop waiting – take control early, &nbsp;dictate the pace, and don’t let the opponent settle into a rhythm. Throw first and throw often. I left the ring wrecked, but still finished the session with three rounds on the bags and four rounds skipping.</p>
<p>Coming into the February Bank Holiday weekend, I was drained from the two external spars and heavy training during the week. In my explosive session on Friday, I focused on speed by halving weight. After resting Saturday, I was back with the footwork and cardio on Sunday, followed by a late-night event, where I didn’t get home until 3 am. Still, I trained Monday as usual and had a strong strength session Tuesday, hitting new weights on all lifts.</p>
<p>In Mulhuddart on Wednesday, I sparred with the same two guys. One had figured me out – closed the distance fast and kept the pressure high. Against the other, I worked the body and added second-phase attacks. While I caught most shots on my guard, I took a few hard shots as well.</p>
<p>By the end of Week 5, I’d banked 30 sessions: 7 club, 4 external spars, 8 technical/footwork, and 11 gym.</p>
<p>On paper, things looked great! In reality, I was edging towards the red. My plan to mitigate the risks of overtraining had held so far. But as Eisenhower said,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Plans are worthless, planning is everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or in Mike Tyson’s words</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Everyone has a plan until they get hit in the face.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I, had been hit in the face. Tune in next week to see how that plan panned out.</p>
